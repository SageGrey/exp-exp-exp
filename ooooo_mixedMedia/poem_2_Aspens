# Aspens


       When I let myself open up
       and look at where it hurts--
       where lives have been destroyed 
       by violence or a thousand insults
       I often start thinking about you. 
       
       I sit and I marvel at how long you are able
       to reach out and touch your fingers to a candle's flame.
       How firmly you can lodge your body in the crest of the wave, 
       resisting the riptide
       as well as the call of the shore. 
       
       It makes a lot of sense that your favorite trees are aspens. 
       Points of simple beauty that bend and sway
       but ever stop reaching straight up.
       
       I found out just now that aspen roots grow near the surface. 
       By staying shallow, just beneath, 
       they are able to sprout new trees. 
       
       
       Aspens, I imagine, must not ask too many questions about what is enough. 
       They dont seem to think that their root depth is inadequate,
       maybe they just know to grow in the ways that they can.
