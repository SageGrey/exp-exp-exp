Poems of Jarold K Anderson

# Candle Facts # 1

If you whisper a secret to a candle flame
then all fire everywhere will know that secret. 

The words will crackle in every campfire 
and churn like an ocean deep in the belly of the Earth. 

Fire will translate your words to smoke and ash, 
telling no one but the sky. 


# Seriously Though

If you can make peace with the unlikely fact 
that squids the side of school buses patrol the dark oceans 
at a depth that would crush you to paste, 

then I have faith you can also make peace with the unlikely fact 
that you are worthy of all the happiness you have imagined.
