# Skateparks and Olmstead

In January of 2022, the skatescene of Mexico City received the authortitative mark of cultural status, a full length article in the New York Times. The article, _Out of Nowhere, A Rising Scene For Skateboarders In Mexico City_ documented the transforamtion of a city with next-to-no skate shops into a haven for skaters of all kinds. The transformation of CDMX into a haven for skateboards is tied to the deep investment on the part of the city government to construction skateparks throughout the city. I argue that the sucess of these parks can in part be understood by the way in which they map onto Olmstead's beliefs in an (eco)system of parks.
