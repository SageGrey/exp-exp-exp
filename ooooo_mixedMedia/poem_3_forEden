# stop wanting to fall


i wish i could lean back
shift the weight 
from toes 
to heels
to past the heels
to when shoulders fall back

and i wish i would start falling 
feel the weight leave my body
the concern leave my forhead
the stress leave my jaw

i've heard that some can find this through meditation
but i want an ether
a whole universe to use

when i can't fall, 
i remember to call you
there is so much relief in conversation
a few words releases the desperation of exhaustion
your excitement interrupts my desire to fall 
with the effectiveness of
a jump cut
a bucket of water
slapped heels

you cant give me an ether, 
but you can make me want to stand back up
in this one
