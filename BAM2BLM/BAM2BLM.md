# Freedom Dream
I want to be in an a network of humans who see pleasure as essential, broadens whose pleasure is considered,  defends pleasure's costs, and are skilled at cultivating and nourishing pleasure. I want to do this by meeting and connecting with passionate folks, synthesizing ideas, inventing, communicating, and finding my own pleasure. In doing this, I want to feel full and alive.  
# Mixtape Name
* The land of Puppies and Flower
# Project Ideas
I want to take a series of headlines and newspaper stories about public transit and rewrite them to reflect a pleasurable and gorgeous freedom dream of what public transit could look like.

**For Example:** 

|Current | Freedom Dream|
|---|---|
|CTA bringing back security dogs, three years after removing them from train platforms | Cuddles on the Platform, CTA signs contract with emotional support animal company |
|MBTA plans to crack down on fare evasion with new commuter rail gates| MBTA plans to crack down on boredom with pinball machines and arcade games at rail gates|
||Lighten the load: MBTA to re-introduce public lockers at T stations. at 


MBTA to increase to hire expanded cleaning crews. 

MBTA to release art on the Smolnet. New artworks only available on MBTA platforms. Artworks include meditation sound baths, storytelling from Boston Elders, Middle School Choir Performances, High School Open Mics
