For this Bluebike partnership I'm interested in exploring a partnership with public and private sector that inverts the relationship between the public being the consumer and the private sector being the producer. The proposal for how this would work is described in detail below, but the general gist is that the city would partner with local businesses in the way that a credit card rewards program or Groupon partners with private businesses. The city offers to help advertise local businesses through their platform in return for private businesses "matching" Bluebike point rewards. One advantage of this system would be to allow small businesses across sectors partner with the transportation department while helping the city "deliver value for public money ^[4]."

**The Idea**:  Bluebike increases the rewards for rebalancing a bike through the Bluebike Angels program. Instead of points that accrue to only very small advantages, Bluebikes sets the renumeration at something like 1$ for every 4 points.  Riders will have the option to "cash out" directly through Bluebikes or cash out through community businesses. 

The city will setup a portal that allows local businesses to opt-into becoming Bluebike Angel community partners. Once they have opted in and been approved by city staff, the business will be searchable through the "rewards" section of the Bluebikes app. A Bluebike angel rider can then choose to go to any of these businesses and "cash in" their points at this location through the app. After a purchase at a participating business, the city will compensate the local business according to the agreed upon rate.  Businesses will be allowed to change their rewards program on a predictable basis (monthly, quarterly etc.). 


**Rewards** 
Rewards: A business can choose to set any or all of the following rewards. 

**Base Conversion:** For every $1 of Bluebike Angel rewards, we will offer $__  in store credit. (Bluebikes will pay the business $1 for every 4 points cashed in. Minimum amplifier is set at $5 for every $1 of Bluebike awards). 

**10 Point Award:** If a Bluebike rider cashes in 10 points they will receive  BLANK SPACE  (For every 10 points, the city will pay the business $1.25. Value of 10 point reward MUST be a minimum of a 5 dollar Value ) 

**50 Point Award:** If a Bluebike rider cashes in 50 points they will receive BLANK SPACE _____ (For every 50 points, the city will pay the business $6.25. Value of 50 point reward MUST be a minimum of a 25 dollar Value )  

Example: 
	* JP Licks decides that the reward for **10 Bluebike Angel Points** is a single scoop ice cream cone and **50 Bluebike Angel Points** is a medium ice cream cake. 
	* Porter Square Nails decides that for **10 Bluebike Angel Points** they will upgrade a regular manicure to a gel manicure. And for **50 Bluebike Angel Points** they will give a free regular manicure. 
	* Tags Hardware decides that for every 1$ in Bluebike Angel points, they will match $5 in store credit. 





**For Non-Members:** Make rides that take a bike from a surplus station to a deficit station free. Fare would be refunded once the bike is returned. Fees for additional time and security deposit remain in place.
