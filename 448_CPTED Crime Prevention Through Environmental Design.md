CPTED is a design strategy from the 1960s that sought to reduce crime through design. The designs were developed by a criminologist that embraced a conception of crime based on victims and perpetrators. The designs were taken up with the popularity of tough on crime strategies and broken window policing. The interventions use a carceral logic and promote hostile architecture. 

Some of the designs associated with CPTED were
1. Remove Seating to prevent "undesirable" people loitering 
2. Remove rain or sun coverings to improve sightlines
3. Reduce number of station entrances and exits to better control movement.  
4. Put surveillance booths high to be able to look down at fare gates
