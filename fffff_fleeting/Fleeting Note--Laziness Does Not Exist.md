**Quotes**


And that’s why I’m writing this piece. I’m hoping to awaken my fellow educators — of all levels — to the fact that if a student is struggling, they probably _aren’t choosing to_. They probably want to do well. They probably are trying. More broadly, I want all people to take a curious and empathic approach to individuals whom they initially want to judge as “lazy” or irresponsible.

If a person can’t get out of bed, something is making them exhausted. If a student isn’t writing papers, there’s some aspect of the assignment that they can’t do without help. If an employee misses deadlines constantly, something is making organization and deadline-meeting difficult. Even if a person is actively choosing to self-sabotage, there’s a reason for it — some fear they’re working through, some need not being met, a lack of self-esteem being expressed.

People do not choose to fail or disappoint. No one wants to feel incapable, apathetic, or ineffective. If you look at a person’s action (or inaction) and see only laziness, you are missing key details. There is always an explanation. There are always barriers. Just because you can’t see them, or don’t view them as legitimate, doesn’t mean they’re not there. Look harder.


. [Situational constraints typically predict behavior](http://psycnet.apa.org/record/1979-28632-001) far [better than personality](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/a85d/432f44e43d61753bb8a121c246127b562a39.pdf), intelligence, or other individual-level traits.

There are always barriers. Recognizing those barriers— and viewing them as legitimate — is often the first step to breaking “lazy” behavior patterns.

It’s really helpful to respond to a person’s ineffective behavior with curiosity rather than judgment. I learned this from a friend of mine, [the writer and activist](http://mikeverett.tumblr.com/) [Kimberly Longhofer](https://www.facebook.com/pg/changelikethemoon/photos/?ref=page_internal) (who publishes under the name Mik Everett).

Kim is the person who taught me that judging a homeless person for wanting to buy alcohol or cigarettes is utter folly. When you’re homeless, the nights are cold, the world is unfriendly, and everything is painfully uncomfortable. Whether you’re sleeping under a bridge, in a tent, or at a shelter, it’s hard to rest easy. You are likely to have injuries or chronic conditions that bother you persistently, and little access to medical care to deal with it. You probably don’t have much healthy food.

In that chronically uncomfortable, over-stimulating context, needing a drink or some cigarettes makes fucking sense. As Kim explained to me, if you’re laying out in the freezing cold, drinking some alcohol may be the only way to warm up and get to sleep. If you’re under-nourished, a few smokes may be the only thing that kills the hunger pangs. And if you’re dealing with all this while also fighting an addiction, then yes, sometimes you just need to score whatever will make the withdrawal symptoms go away, so you can survive.

Few people who haven’t been homeless think this way. They want to moralize the decisions of poor people, [perhaps to comfort themselves about the injustices of the world](https://search.proquest.com/openview/159361c93f85137642f79287c6fa20d2/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&cbl=18750&diss=y). For many, it’s [easier to think homeless people are, in part, responsible](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1467-9221.2006.00506.x) [for their suffering](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jasp.12201) than it is to acknowledge the situational factors.

And when you don’t fully understand a person’s context — what it feels like to be them every day, all the small annoyances and major traumas that define their life — it’s easy to impose abstract, rigid expectations on a person’s behavior. _All homeless people should put down the bottle and get to work. Never mind that most of them have mental health symptoms and physical ailments, and are fighting constantly to be recognized as human. Never mind that they are unable to get a good night’s rest or a nourishing meal for weeks or months on end. Never mind that even in my comfortable, easy life, I can’t go a few days without craving a drink or making an irresponsible purchase. They have to do better._

But they’re already doing the best they can. I’ve known homeless people who worked full-time jobs, and who devoted themselves to the care of other people in their communities. A lot of homeless people have to navigate bureaucracies constantly, interfacing with social workers, case workers, police officers, shelter staff, Medicaid staff, and a slew of charities both well-meaning _and_ condescending. It’s a lot of fucking work to be homeless. And when a homeless or poor person runs out of steam and makes a “bad decision,” there’s a damn good reason for it.

**If a person’s behavior doesn’t make sense to you, it is because you are missing a part of their context.** It’s that simple. I’m so grateful to Kim and their writing for making me aware of this fact. No psychology class, at any level, taught me that. But now that it is a lens that I have, I find myself applying it to all kinds of behaviors that are mistaken for signs of moral failure — and I’ve yet to find one that can’t be explained and empathized with.


A lot of my colleagues would look at this student and think she was lazy, disorganized, or apathetic. I know this because I’ve _heard_ how they talk about under-performing students. There’s often rage and resentment in their words and tone — _why won’t this student take my class seriously? Why won’t they make me feel important, interesting, smart?_


 I can see the external factors that lead to these problems. Just as I know that “lazy” behavior is not an active choice, I **know that judgmental, elitist attitudes are typically borne out of situational ignorance.**


 And that’s why I’m writing this piece. I’m hoping to awaken my fellow educators — of all levels — to the fact that if a student is struggling**, they probably _aren’t choosing to_.**


**Maybe you weren’t always able to look at human behavior this way. That’s okay. Now you are. Give it a try.**
