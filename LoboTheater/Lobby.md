The Lobo theater opened doors in Mid-August 1938, it was a staple of Nob Hill until its close in 2000 for cult films, bands and premiere runs. In the early aughts, it was bought by Calvary Church. The church let a number of folks use the space, including Patricio Trujillo. The fearless, queer, leader and educator of generations of Monte Vista Elementary students who needed something to do after school until their parents got out of work.
