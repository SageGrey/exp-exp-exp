The Southeast Fire Map is a data visualization tool created through the Natural Resource Conservation Service (NRCS), a division of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) tasked with furthering conservation goals. As part of their mission, NRCS funds conservation and agriculture research at universities across the country and then distributes the information so that decision makers (government officials, conservationists, foresters, etc.) can make decisions with what NRCS describes as "the best available science."

One way that the department does this is by creating "Decision Support Tools." Generally these are online tools that allow users to wade through decades of data collected. 

One decision support tool launched recently is the Southeastern Fire Map. A tool that attempts to help coordinate land stewardship practices such as controlled burns and brush clearance. The tool uses remote sensing to identify prescribed burns as well as wildfires.

The tool allows users to look at:
* Fire Frequency: the number of times a parcel has burned over the 30-year time period. 
* Time Since Previous Fire (TSPF) & Year Last Burned (YLB): Measurements of how long it has been since the last fire. 
* Fire Free Interval (FFI): The time between two consecutive fires in a given location. 
The tool is not explicitly intended as an artistic expression of the data.
