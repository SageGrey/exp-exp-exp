The story that usually gets told about Private Firefighter is about the outrage of some wealthy individual who is able to protect their property while the adjacent parcels burn. 

Another story worth listening to may be the stories of those who find employment with these private companies. On the whole it seems that the private companies offer way less training, lower wages, and fewer benefits than traditional employment. But they may have fewer requirements (such as the EMT license that keeps many formerly incarcerated folks ineligible). 

There is increasing tension between government fire fighters and private forces. In the California Glass Fire, a crew of private fire fighters were detained by police. The arrest came after accusations of the crew lighting back-fires (which was never proven) and being in a mandatory evacuation zone. (Ulmer & Ulmer, 2021) 

Tension between fire fighting units has historic precedent. There were notorious rivalries between volunteer firefighter forces in cities like New York City and Baltimore in early 19th century (Magazine & Landers, n.d.).
