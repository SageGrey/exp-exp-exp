*This weekly reflection starts with an entirely unrelated fact about bike share. As of 2014, in more than 23 million rides, no deaths have been reported on a bike share bike in any city across the US (Reuters, 2014). *

Building off the lecture today, I want to muse on what arguments can be made for subsidizing a bikeshare program? 


**Reason 1:** Enhancing Safety
A well documented phenomenon is that the more bicyclists are on the road, the safer it is for everyone cycling. Reporting and research on bikeshare programs indicate that cities that introduce bike share programs have seen a reduction in overall bicycle accidents (Stromberg, 2014). 

**Reason 2**: Enhancing Public Transit. 
Bike Share programs are discussed as a way to solve the last-mile solution. Bus and rail trips can be paired with bikeshare to substantially expand the transit network. Enhancing the reach of public transit can in turn reduce the numbers of cars on the road which could then reduce pressure on parking infrastructure, and traffic/congestion. 

**Reason 3:** Health Promoting Behavior 
Bike share is seen as a way to embed "healthy" behaviors into commuting. Because biking allows riders to exercise during transit there could be an argument that bike share allows users to scratch away against sedentary lifestyles. 

**Reason 4:** Cutting Emissions
Bike share is often justified as a way to cut emissions. Bike share systems can be much less polluting than other modes of transit, however, analysis of the emissions cost of the rebalancing vans should be considered. 



**Reason 5** Increased Economic Growth
This reason might be less applicable to American cities, but researchers looking at Beijing's bikeshare program found time savings for workers which they theorize could help boost economic growth. "Our results show that bike-sharing in Beijing can help each worker save an average of 8 min per day." (Lu-yi et al, 2018)
