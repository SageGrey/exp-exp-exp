For the community gathering in a few months, I want to bring to the space an exercise that will give the opportunity to those gathered to join me in visioning what transportation could look like if we centered pleasure. Working off of the groundbreaking work of the Alliance for Community Transit Los Angeles (ACT-LA), I will work to develop a visioning exercise that allows us to take the current state of affairs in Boston--a world where public transit is underfunded and over-policed--- and for a moment, transform it to the world we want. 

The following pages discuss some of the theory and inspiration behind this project.

## Theory and Inspiration

**Freedom Dreams**
This work is grounded in an appreciation for visionaries such as Audre Lorde, Bell Hooks, Grace Lee Boggs, Octavia Butler, Robin DG Kelley, and Adrienne Maree Brown who argue that in the face of crippling injustice, we can and must employ our imagination, and turn towards hope and pleasure and joy as a way forward.   Robin D. G. Kelley's freedom dreams and Adrienne Maree Brown's articulation of pleasure activism are especially central to my current thinking. This project is in essence an attempt to cultivate what Kelley calls, 'New Visions'[^1] and answers Adrienne Maree Brown's provocation, "How would we organize and move our communities if we shifted to focus on what we long for and love rather than what we are reacting to?" [^2]


**Pleasure as part of Just Transition** 


The Just Transition framework (shown below) is described by Climate Justice Alliance as "a vision-led, unifying and place-based set of principles, processes and practices that build economic and political power to shift from an extractive economy to a regenerative economy."[^3] The framework is a synthesis of ideology that traces its roots to labor unions and environmental justice groups. 

The framework articulates the strategy needed to shift from an extractive economy to what is described as a living economy. The extractive economy, the current status quo, is a paradigm where resources are recklessly extracted, consumed and discarded, labor is exploited, and wealth and power is denied to all but a small minority. This extractive economy is supported by state violence and a worldview that embraces growth, consumption, and colonial extraction.  The living economy in contrast is one where resources are collected in a sustainable and regenerative fashion with non-extractive labor practices based on cooperation. Instead of enriching a small minority, the benefits of this economy are distributed. The system is not governed by imperial powers and violence but through a system where decision making is brought back to the smallest relevant scale and individuals are in control of decisions that impact their lives. This system is guided by a worldview that centers caring and treating life and environments as sacred. 

The overall strategy for this transition is to "starve and stop" the extractive economy and "feed and grow" the living economy. 

The following are six components denoted as part of this transition. 
* Reallocate economic resources and power away from international forces towards community control. 
* Create more in income distribution and workplaces (Democratize the Workplace )
* Push for more ecological restoration of degraded environments
* Work towards racial justice and social equity
* Create systems of production and consumption that keep the system local
* Support and restore cultural traditions and knowledge

The most obvious way that centering pleasure in our transportation networks intersects with Just Transition principles is how it aligns with the world view that the living economy requires. The just transition seeks to move a culture obsessed with growth and consumption into a culture that centers care and sustainability. 

If we strive to embed care into public transportation, we are in essence striving to care for the people who use it. We are not focusing on incorporating pleasure only because it will get workers to work faster, increase the amount consumers would spend, or that it would reduce the amount of spending on social services. Instead we would do it as a way to respect and care for those using the system. Its possible that embedding pleasure could have positive repercussions, such as buoyed mood, reduced mental strain, social interaction---but these factors would likely do little to further the consolidation of wealth and power and would instead contribute to what the just transition describes as 'Ecological and Social Well-being' 

A less direct, but potentially powerful way reason that I think we should center pleasure is that it lets us tap into our knowledge of satiation. Many writers and thinkers in our era are attempting to document how corporate and government forces have fostered a mindset of growth. Abby Spinak writes about how REA (rural electric agency) pressured consumers into consuming more energy through subsidizing and advertising consumer appliances such as dishwashers while promising a 'freedom from drudgery' that never would arrive [^4]. Evan McKenzie writes about the pervasive myth of passive supply that is able to pretend that producers are only responding to demand instead of actively creating it[^5].  

When I think about the formation of a mindset that embraces and needs growth, I think about where satiation is absent. Growth in the modern capitalist era is not simply an increase of people who want goods/services, but an increase in how much an individual wants. This expansion of how much the individual wants tends to be treated as an unlimited capacity that is only limited by their means. However, where does this notion of unlimited capacity come from? We do not want to eat an unlimited amount, at some point we are full. We do not want to sleep an unlimited amount, at some point we want to get up. We do not want to have unlimited sex, at some point we are satiated. I think a way to think about this unlimited consumption is about ways that our satisfaction or satiation can be hidden or denied by forces outside of ourselves. 
I do not think that unchecked desire is a natural state of being, but rather one that comes from a manipulated state of denied pleasure. I have no way of knowing if this is true, but I have an inkling that if we work to recenter pleasure, and are successful in fostering more pleasure, this would soften the grip of a desire for more. 

Pleasure = Satisfaction    
Satisfaction = Satiated  
Satiated = Enough  
Enough = Anti-Growth  
Pleasure = Anti-Growth  

Denied Pleasure = Dissatisfaction  
Dissatisfaction = Yearning  
Yearning = Wanting More  
Wanting More = Growth  
Denied Pleasure = Growth
