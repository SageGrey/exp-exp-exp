"Im having a hard time answering the questions because they are being asked in passive voice. Who is asking these questions."


**manouevers:**
* See Triggers Anonymously: closing eyes, asking participants to raise their hands if they have a trigger
* talking openly about impulse to being a people pleaser
* asking what reciprocity feels like
* bringing snacks


**pit-falls:** 
repeating the same points 
starting energy too somber
making assumptions about a student
not giving enough time for a presenter to communicate their ideas
falling in love with an assignment


**Presentations**
* Explaining images/diagrams on the slide and why youve included them
