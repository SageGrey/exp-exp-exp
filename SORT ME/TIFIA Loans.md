This week I wanted to look at examples of debt financing for bicycle infrastructure and federal funding for bike infrastructure generally. 

**Federal Funding**
A brief on transportation.gov website indicates that between 1992 and 2012 more than $7.2 billion of federal funds have been spent on cycling infrastructure [^1]. This is likely an undercount because some states don't count funding that is part of larger projects (ie installing a dedicated bike lane by itself is counted, but adding a dedicated bike lane in a road-widening project is not). 

Some trends that the DOT identified in their funding was that counties with higher level of poverty were less likely to implement bike projects [^2].  

MAP-21 consolidated bike and pedestrian efforts into the Transportation Alternatives Program. Of these funds, half are allocated to metro planning organizations while the rest are given to states to "distribute through a competitive grant process" [^3]  additional funding is available through the Congestion Mitigation Air Quality (CMAQ) Program. 

**Example of TIFIA Loans***

The first example of debt financing I looked at was a Build American Bond given to the the BelRed Street Network in Bellevue, Washington. The TIFIA direct loan for $99.60 million covered approximately 30% of the project cost to improve 12 multimodal roadways [^4] . The project would add pedestrian improvements, 25,000 feet of sidewalk, 21,000 feet of bike lanes, and enhancements to bike signaling. 

Total Cost: $323.20 Million 
**Funding Sources**
City of Bellevue:  $158.9 million  (49%) 
TIFIA loan:  $99.6 million  (30%)
Sound Transit:  $22.4 million  (7%)
Federal Grant:  $22.1 million  (7%)
State Grant:  $17.6 million  (5%)
Private Contributions:  $2.6 million (0.1%)
