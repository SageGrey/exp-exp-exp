### MIT 11.173 Infrastructure Design for Climate Change

My name is Sage, Im a masters student of urban planning at the Graduate School of Design at Harvard. I'm originally from New Mexico and plan to eventually return in the next 5-10 years.  I was raised half in Albuquerque and half in rural Northern New Mexico near La Puebla and Pojoaque. I came to planning because I hoped that it would be a vocation where I could scratch away at some of the institutionalized injustice of the United States. 

I am taking this class because I want to learn more about a civil engineering approach to design. I'm more familiar with the urban planning community engagement design process and have some "design thinking" experience, but want to broaden my understanding. I'm ultimately interested in how infrastructure (especially transportation and flood infrastructure) can better center pleasure and joy.But I feel that I need to better understand the field in order to advocate for what is likely to, without care, be written off as fluff. 

I would like to learn in this class the general pattern of an infrastructure design process from problem articulation to development. I would also like to better understand my understanding of what is currently possible in the realm of climate-impact mitigation infrastructure.
