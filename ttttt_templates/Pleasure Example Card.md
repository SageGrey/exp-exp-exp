**Short Description**: Set a spending cap for daily/weekly public transit fares

**Card Type**: #Precedent

**Full Description**: Fare capping controls the maximum amount of money that someone spends on public transit in a given time interval. NYC has put into place a system that puts a weekly cap on fares for passengers using the OMNY pay system. After you've paid $33 (12 trips) in any given week, any additional rides will be free. Generally fare capping allows lower-income folks to achieve the same cost-saving advantages as a monthly/yearly pass, without requiring that the money is paid in full at the start of the pay period.
