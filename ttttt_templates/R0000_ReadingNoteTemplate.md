###### Reading Notes

|Page| What's it about| 
|---|---|
|5| **Substitution** explains why the *law of demand* works. If all else is equal, when the price of something goes up, less of that thing will be purchased because folks will turn to something else to satisfy their desire |
|6| "Ability to substitute depends on timescale" + Why Aggregating demand is important|
|7| **Complements** are commodities that are consumed together. If the price of one rises, both will likely see decreased demand| |
|8|Demand Curve Explanation|
|9|Shifts to Demand Curves|
|10|**Price Responsiveness:** Elastic + Inelastic Demand|
|11|**Income Effect**: An increase in wage rates increases an incentive to work|
|12|luxuries and necessities|
|13|1% changes|
|14|**Cost-of-living indexes:**  calculate the cost of buying a given bundle of consumer goods, usually the one actually chosen at an original set of prices.|
|15|Relative price changes, overcompensating seniors|
|16|Problems with choosing a base city for comparison|
|17| **Babysitter effect**. Original $20 vs $200 dinner choice (1:10), but after you add a $40 babysitter cost, $60 vs $240 (4:1).See this in foreign car imports|
|18|Opportunity Cost, Risk|
|19|Risk Aversion (Loss Aversion)|
|20| Insurance Pools: **Law of Large Numbers:** "adding together many independent random outcomes averages out their uncertainty."|
|21|Investment risk considerations (blue-chip stocks), Hedging|
|22| hedging example: not buying stock in the company/industry you work for|
|23|behavioral economics supplanting traditional econ theories|
| |work of **Daniel Kahneman** system 1 (instinct) & System 2 (slow calculation)|
|24|Why someone might use system 2|
|| **Endowment Effect:** Placing additional value on an object because you own it|
|25| Unfairness, Explanation of the Ultimatum Game $10 divided by a and b study|
|26|Nudges, Making Green/Healthy Plans as Default|
|27| Paternalism?|

###### Quotes/Excerpts
* Consumers make their decisions using some combination of calculation and instinct -5
* The relationship between the price of something and its quantity demanded is useful for economic analysis only if it is reasonably stable and can be estimated or forecast. -6
* f your wage rate increases from $20 an hour to $25 an hour, you will probably increase your hours of work somewhat, say from 40 hours a week to 45 (to the extent that you have such flexibility).--11
*  **two economists meet after a long time and are catching up on each other's news. One asks: ‘How is your wife?’ The other answers: ‘Compared to whom?**’ --18
* Even when someone wants to think about a decision in the consciously calculating framework of System II, the required information and the complexity of the calculation may prevent him or her from doing a perfect job of it. This may be especially important in decisions of the poor, who have too many things to think about: juggling multiple jobs, how the cost of every single item can fit into their limited budgets, and so on.-23
* Perhaps the most important finding of Kahneman and others is that consumers care not only about what they finally ended up with, but also how it compares to some _reference point_, which depending on the context can be their status quo level of income or consumption, the level they regard as normal in their p. 24community, or some other standard of comparison. -23
* Perhaps the most important finding of Kahneman and others is that consumers care not only about what they finally ended up with, but also how it compares to some _reference point_, which depending on the context can be their status quo level of income or consumption, the level they regard as normal in their community, or some other standard of comparison.--24 
* The prime example is the **‘ultimatum game’.** Of two players A and B, one, say A, is chosen at random to propose division of a sum like $10 between the two. If B accepts A's proposal, it is implemented; if B rejects it, neither gets anything. Cold economic logic suggests that B's choice p. 25is between something and nothing, and so B should therefore accept whatever A offers, even if it is just one penny. In fact many Bs reject anything short of about $3. And anticipating this, or driven by their own sense of fairness, most As offer more, quite often an equal split. If the role of proposer is not randomly assigned, but based on scores in a prior puzzle-solving contest, many B's are willing to accept smaller shares—presumably because they think A's success in the contest has earned him or her the right to a higher share!
