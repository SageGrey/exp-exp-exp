# Make SROs Legal
Created: Jul-02-2022


In his article "Legalize housing, not tent encampments" Yglesias describes the multi-faceted strategy that american policy makers used to make boarding houses, SROs and other cheap ways of finding housing illegal. This includes changes to zoning laws that specified square footage minimums (for example nyc mandates at least 680 sq feet), requiring unnatainable parking minimums for subdividing houses that would effectively prohibit a house being subdivided, and laws that barred unrelated people living together (such as the [286_Village of Belle Terre v. Boraas](286_Village%20of%20Belle%20Terre%20v.%20Boraas.md).  

Yglesias goes on to argue that the language coming out of publications such as the American Planning Association’s 1957 report on rooming houses indicates that the primary motivation was less the wellbeing of the roomers, but the property values of the well-to-do residents. He cites a passage in the report, “besides protecting the roomers, enforcement of these codes can do a great deal to assure that rooming houses do not harm districts in which they are properly located.”*
