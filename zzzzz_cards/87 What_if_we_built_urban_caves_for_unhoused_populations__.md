# What if we built urban caves for unhoused populations? 

What if we put energy into making the experience of being unhoused, less shitty? 

Humans lived without modern dwellings for a very long time. What if while we try to fix homelessness, we in the meantime provide better accomodations for people living on the street. Urban Caves which would provide heat, and protection from the elements. 

What if you could camp in the middle of a city, legally?
