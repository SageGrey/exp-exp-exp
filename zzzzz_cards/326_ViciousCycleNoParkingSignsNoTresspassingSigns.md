Signage can create the perception that a problem is acute even if it is not in fact a problem. for example, no tresspassing signs, which are required in many places for police to enfore no-tresspassing rules, can create the sense that a place is dangerous or unfriendly. No Parking, Space Reserved parking signs can create the impression that parking is limited when in fact it is not.
