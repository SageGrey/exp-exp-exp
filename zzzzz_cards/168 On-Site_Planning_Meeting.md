# On-Site Planning Meeting

During a virtual planning meeting for Walden Square Apartments (March 2021, Mid-Pandemic), Arnav lamented how much easier this meeting would be if it was actually happening on site, in-person. It did not occur to him that planning meetings are held in rooms somewhere else where the same difficulty of communicating details about a physical space in a different physical space persist. 

What if we get some chairs and have the meetings on-site. What dynamic changes when this is the case?
