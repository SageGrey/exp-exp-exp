# Lowell City Councilor Lawsuit

In 2017 a lawsuit in Lowell was filed against the system of at-large city council seats. The primary contention was that the current system--where all nine of the city councilor positions were elected at-large--illegally diluted the voting power of minorities in the city. Strong evidence pointing towards the validity of this claim is the fact that, at the time of the lawsuit, 5 of the 9 city councilor reps were white men from the affluent neighborhood Belvidere. Belvidere residents in recent past elections have accounted for around half of all voters.* The lawsuit lead to a change where the city maintained 3 at-large councilors but created 8 neighborhood specific positions.
