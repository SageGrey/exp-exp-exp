# 1956 Learning Spanish from High School Dropouts

"In 1956 there arose a need to teach spanish quickly to several hundred teachers, social workers, and ministers from the New York Archdiocese so that they could communicate with Puerto Rican. My friendGerry Morris announced over a Spanish Radio station that he needed native speakers from Harlem. NExt day some two hundred teen-agers lined up in front of his office and he selected four dozen of them--many of them school dropouts. He trained them in the use of the U.S. Foreign service Institute FSI manual, designed for use by linguists with graduate training, and within a week his teachers were on their own--each in charge of four new yorkers who wanted to speak the language. Within six months the mission was accomplished.'
