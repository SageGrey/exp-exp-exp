# what am I looking at

When I started this project this week, I decided that I wanted to explore the infrastructre of digital storage and traditional "organization" tools for academia and life. Inspired by Abby's instruction to think about how infrastructure disciplines our bodies, I spent a fair amount of time looking through my desktops and notebooks asking myself how these spaces influenced my thinking. However, it has really been in the experimentation of building new tools that I've been able to surface for myself this influence. Some of the efforts to liberate myself from traditional tools (such as using a zettlekasten) have been ongoing projects over the last year, but other efforts (such as port authority, spatialized notes on gitghub) are endeavors started in the last two weeks. 


#### But where?
I have gathered some observations on how digitial infrastructure has influenced me, you can read these in the [Dining Room](https://github.com/SageGrey/exp-exp-exp/blob/main/xxxxx_locations/4_DiningRoom.md)  


The presents under the [festivus pole](5_livingRoom.md) are where I have described some of the [convivial tools](219_ConvivialTools.md) I've started using

I just want to go back to the beginning. [Sure thing](3_FestivusCelebration.md)
