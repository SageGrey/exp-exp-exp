It occured to me recenty that the difficulty that I was having in following through on building skills, such as dedicating time each day to practicing spanish, drawing, skating, did not stem so much from a problem with time management or self-discipline, but rather from an unchecked desire of what I wanted from myself. I was not succeeding in the mandate to [desire as little as possible, be at grateful as you can for what you already have](zzzzz_cards/desire%20as%20little%20as%20possible,%20be%20at%20grateful%20as%20you%20can%20for%20what%20you%20already%20have.md) when it applied to what I wanted from myself.
