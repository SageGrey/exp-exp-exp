It occured to me recenty that the difficulty that I was having in following through on building skills, such as dedicating time each day to practicing spanish, drawing, skating, did not stem so much from a problem with time management or self-discipline, but rather from an unchecked desire of what I wanted from myself. I was not succeeding in the mandate to [[desire as little as possible, be at grateful as you can for what you already have]] when it applied to what I wanted from myself.
