# There are patterns in a keysmash

Internet Linguist Gretchen McCulloch points out that even keysmashes have a certain pattern. To begin, they ovewhelingly start with the letter a. They tend to use the keys on the homerow. Some folks who use the Dvorak keyboard (where the homerow begins with vowels) have reported stopping keysmashing because their layout makes it "socially illegible."

In her analysis of key smashes she shares the idea about human pattern seeking that, "It's not just that we make patterns. It's that even when we're not trying to make patterns, when we think we are just a billion monkeys mashing incoherently on a billion keyboards, we're social monkeys--we can't help but notice each other and respond to each other. Even when something looks incoherent to an outsider, even when it's intended as incoherent for an insider, we as humans are practically incapable of doing things without patterns.

She points out that while there were a few "keysmash purists" some people will retype keysmashes to make them look a certain way, with a minority changing specific letters to conform to what a key smash 'should' look like.
