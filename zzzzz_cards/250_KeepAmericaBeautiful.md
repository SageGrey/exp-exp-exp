## Keep America Beautiful

The Keep America Beautiful (KAB.org) non-profit was established in 1953 in response to litter that was accumulating alongside of the brand-new interstate highway system. The non-profit was launched by businessesmen affiliated with the American Can Company and Owens Illinois Glass Co (Rickards, 2022). 1953 was _coincidentally_ the same year that Vermont passed the country's first bottle ban which prohibitted selling beer in non-refillable bottles (Gantry, 2006). The non-profit would later recieve funding from Coca-Cola and Dixie Cup Co (Rickards, 2022). The most infamous campaign launched by Keep America Beautiful was the "Crying Indian" campaign launched in 1971. The commercial featured Italian-American actor Espera Oscar DeCorti (with makeup darkening his skin) dressed up as a Native American man in traditional dress (Rickards, 2022) crying in response to litter desecrating the land. In 1974, durin the period that the California legislature was considering a bottle ban, KAB made the decision to publicly oppose the bill.
