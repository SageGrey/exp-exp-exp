## Keep America Beautiful

The Keep America Beautiful (KAB.org) non-profit was established in 1953 in response to litter that was accumulating alongside of the brand-new interstate highway system. The non-profit was launched by businessesmen affiliated with the American Can Company and Owens Illinois Glass Co (Rickards, 2022). 1953 was _coincidentally_ the same year that Vermont passed the country's first bottle ban which prohibitted selling beer in non-refillable bottles (Gantry, 2006). The non-profit would later recieve funding from Coca-Cola and Dixie Cup Co (Rickards, 2022). The most infamous campaign launched by Keep America Beautiful was the "Crying Indian" campaign launched in 1971. The commercial featured Italian-American actor Espera Oscar DeCorti (with makeup darkening his skin) dressed up as a Native American man in traditional dress (Rickards, 2022) crying in response to litter desecrating the land. In 1974, durin the period that the California legislature was considering a bottle ban, KAB made the decision to publicly oppose the bill. At the same time, KAB  upported fines and jail time for "litterbugs" who threw out trash "innapropriately" (Plumer, 2006). 

The ad campaigns of KAB worked to shift the public perception of blame of litter away from the corporations and onto individual "bad actors" ie litterbugs. At the same time, the non-profit worked to programatically alter the country's legal landscape to stop bills that infringed on their ability to produce trash while supporting legislation that would police consumers.
