# Adding to the Slip Box, Note Sequences

In the original version of the Zettlekasten, Nikolas Luhmann would take his [permanent notes](215_PermanentNotes.md) and add them to his slip box. To add a card, he would peruse through the cards in the slip box until he saw one that could connect to the card he was putting in. He would then put the new note behind that initial note, in essence linking these ideas. As he added more cards to the slip-box, these clusters of notes would take form creating **note sequences**. When Luhmann would then go to write a paper, what he would begin with were note sequences that had accumulated in his zettlekasten. The task of the paper then was not starting from scratch, but rather, editing these note sequences. Luhmann was known to reference his slip box as his converstaion partner and emphasized its centrality in his work. 


In the digital world, there are many options for ways to create links between notes. While Luhmann was limited to a handful of links per card (he would have to handwrite out the card each time he would want to link it) digital storage allows a theoretically unlimited number of links per note. A crucial element however is that _**these links are not the same as keywords or hashtags,**_ the notes are connected not by a category or theme, but by a specific thought that brings two(or more) disperate ideas together. 


#### Reflections on the Slip Box:
1. **Breaking out of Silos** one of the really powerful abilites of the zettlekasten method is that it facilitates connecting ideas from different areas. In most academic spaces I was taught to have a sepearte notebook or folder for each class. Despite the fact that combining ideas from different fields was celebrated--I was taught that in order to stay organized, I needed firm boundaries between subjects. The zettlekasten throws out these distions, and the world is better for it. 

2. **Propmting Connections** one of the really cool thing that the zettlekasten does is create connections between ideas that I wouldn't normally think of on my own. Simply through the act of physically scrolling through a library of my own thoughts, or scanning titles to see where to put an entry, new paths and connections surface. 


3. **Visualizing Connections** Thinking with a zettlekasten reminds me of the difference between doing long-division my head vs doing it on paper. Yes, it is technically possible to do the calculations in my head, but it is so much faster, powerful and accurare to do it on paper. 

4. **Getting Rid of the Blank Page**
