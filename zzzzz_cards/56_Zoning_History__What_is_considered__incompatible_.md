# Zoning History: What is considered "incompatible"

In Kayden's lecture he described the original impetus of NYC 1916 zoning ordinance as emerging from the up-scale department stores recieivng complaints there their well-to-do clientel were mixing on the sidewalk with immigrant workers in the garment district. The impetus of zoning is thus less about the smoke and pollution of factories and that incompatibility, as much as it is about segragating society along class lines
