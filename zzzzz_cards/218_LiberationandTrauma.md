# Driving to Niagra Falls

The way I learned about the Zettlekasten method was that my girlfriend read Sonkhe Ahren's book to me as we drove cross country. Driving fron New Mexico to Maine is a DRIVE, but it was made even more extreme by being in the height of the pandemic[^1]. The chapter I remember most vividly is the one Eden read to me as we drove to Niagra Falls at 4am in the morning after we couldnt sleep for all the rain falling on the tent[^2]. 

Learning to use convivial tools such as the zettlekasten has been an incredibly liberating experience, but it has also been one that has surfaced real trauma stemming from navigating high-pressure academic spaces as a neurodiverse, queer kid. One way this showed up for me was asking Eden for advice or help with some element of the zettlekasten (she has hers absolutely humming) and then becoming immediately defensive and upset the second she started to respond. It was actually not until a second cross-country road trip that we took together that I was able to understand that perhaps a root of my definsiveness was that the tools I had been given earlier in my life to take notes, read texts, and write papers were never ones that helped me and instead made me feel disheveled, incompetent, lazy, and chaotic.
