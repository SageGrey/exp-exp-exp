I want to explore current ways that urban planning practitioners attempt to learn about "scenes" in a given neighborhood or city. And to think about strategies or toolkits that would allow to 





**Things I'm interested in**
* Are there general archetypes across scenes that can be identified such as
     - Venues
     - Promoters/organizers
     - Supporting Businesses

* What are the aspirations of these scenes?
* What are barriers to them acheiving these aspirations? Are any of these within the perview of the city?
* How big are these scenes?


**Deliverables**
* [[ACatalogOfScenesInBoston]]
* A case for why scenes matter
	* Scenes can be what make someone choose to stay or move to a given place
	* Scenes create relationships
	* Scenes bring pleasure
* Toolkit for how planners can catalog and develop understanding the scenes in a given area 

**Reasons why someone would want this info**
* Better understand the zoning that is negatively impacting scenes
* Help make the case for why the city needs X
* Develop particpiatory budgeting


**Want to look into**
* Origin of universities supporting student groups
* Cases of cities reforming zoning based on "scenes"
* Participatory Budgeting for Groups

**Talk to**
* Jake P Smith at Colorado College
* Dan D'Oca
* Nevena
* Abby Spinak
* Jim Stockard
