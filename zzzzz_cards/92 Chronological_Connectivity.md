# Chronological Connectivity

Kunstler talks about Chronological Connectivity to discuss the feelin one has when the buildings and environment around you speak to more than just the present moment. Buildings that both have stood the test of time, as well as make a promise to exist into the future. This is in sharp contrast with buildings that are marked with a design life.
