The Alliance for Community Transit - Los Angeles is a community-led transportation advocacy coalition that brings together over 40 member organizations to collaborate on campaigns that "strive to create just, equitable, sustainable transit systems and neighborhoods for all people in Los Angeles."

One of ACT-LA central initiatives is the 'Metro As Sanctuary' initiative that  demands for a divestment from policing and fare collection on METRO in favor of investments into community safety and public amenities.
