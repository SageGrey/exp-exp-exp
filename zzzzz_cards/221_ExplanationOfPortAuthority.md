# Port Authority

Last week I was setting up a NAS (Network Area Storage), I was on a zoom screenshare with my girlfriend who was helping me choose the correct system configurations. When it came to the stage where I needed to choose a name, I froze with the weight of the task. 

For context, up until one week ago, I have been filled with shame about my file storage systems. My system could best be described as a "nesting doll approach" where periodically-- at key moments of good intentions--I would try to bring order. This order would involve setting up a new file folder system for important documents and then--overwhelmed by the enormous amount of files cluttering the desktop--I would drag everything else into a folder with some variant of the name "Deal With Later." Later tended not to come. 

So when the new task of choosing a name came for my new system, the name Port Authority stood out to me. I liked the play on the words, and I liked thinking of my file storage as a not-very-nice place that nonetheless boasts strong affection in the hearts of millions. 

I actually liked thinking about my file structure as Port Authority so much, that I decided to use it as a way to understand where I was putting the files.

Instead of thinking about my files using [file and folders metaphors](https://github.com/SageGrey/exp-exp-exp/blob/main/zzzzz_cards/210_OfficeCultureMetaphors.md), I'm now trying to make a system that falls somewhere between a memory palace and a MUSH network.

**Things Im Trying:**
Because I find it really funny to mix the MOST type-A system I can think of with this experiment, I'm using the library of congress shorthands when possible (L--> Education, HQ--> Family). 

I'm also trying to play with the notion of WHAT gets put into storage. Some of my rooms, are filled not with documents but simply with gems. For example, the Au Bon Pain in the Main Concourse is just Tuca and Bertie memes. 

I am also, where possible, trying to breakdown barriers between subjects. The Hudson News in the Main Concourse holds all readings for all courses, although there are shelves that are sorted by theme (as well as a staff pics shelf).

I've also done some fire containment:

**Will this system Break-down?** 
Too soon to see, but I think it has a better shot than past attempts for a few reasons. 

1. **Touring the Palace Gardens, Ethics of Care** One of the pieces of advice that I found when searching for file storage best practices was to occasionally "tour the palace gardens" and tidy the way you would a physical space. There are two main ways that I see to make yourself do this. The first is through self-discipline and the second is by cultivating joy in the act of tidying. Self discipline has failed me so far (hi adhd), but I think the possibility of taking pride in world-building and rediscovering gifts I've left myself has a real shot. 

2. **Space is the place** I take great pride in taking care of my physical living spaces. The idea of cleaning or caring for an abstract space doesn't click, taking care of port authority does. 

3. **Stubborness** If this breaks down I have to admit that to my roomates who have been watching me get very excited about this over the last week. Pride is powerful.
