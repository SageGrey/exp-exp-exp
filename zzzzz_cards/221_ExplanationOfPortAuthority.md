# Port Authority

Last week I was setting up a NAS (Network Area Storage), I was on a zoom screenshare with my girlfriend who was helping me choose the correct system configurations. When it came to the stage where I needed to choose a name, I froze with the weight of the task. 

For context, up until one week ago, I have been filled with shame about my file storage systems. My system could best be described as a "nesting doll approach" where periodically-- at key moments of good intentions--I would try to bring order. This order would involve setting up a new file folder system for new documents and then--overwhelmed by the enormous amount of files cluttering the desktop--I would drag everything else into a folder with some variant of the name "Deal With Later." Later tended not to come. 

So when the new task of choosing a name came for my new system, the name Port Authority stood out to me. I liked the idea of a not-very-nice place that nonetheless boasts strong  affection in the hearts of millions.
