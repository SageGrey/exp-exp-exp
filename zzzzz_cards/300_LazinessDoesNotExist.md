# Laziness Does Not Exist

In his article, Laziness Does Not Exist, long-time university professor Devon Price outlines the argument that "Laziness" does not exist.  He argues that people who are characterized as "lazy" are not failing to do what is desired or expected from them due to a feature of their personality, bur rather barriers that are preventing them from completing the task. 

**the argument includes**
* a discussion about prevailing [[301_attitudesTowardsHomelessnessDrinking| attitudes about drinking/smoking while homeless]]
* a discussion of psych research on subject
* story about a former student 
* reminder that [[302_noOneChoosesToFailOrDisappoint | no one chooses to fail]]
* a theory of where [[305_teacherEgo | resentment of laziness ]] can come from
* a definition of [[303_SituationalIgnorance | Situational Ignorance]]
* stay curious: [[304_AdviceOnHowToHelpSomeoneWhoIsStruggling | Advice on how to help someone who is struggling]]
