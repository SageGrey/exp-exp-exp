# Deprofessionalization  + Ivan Illich

The progressive idea of "deprofessionalization" in the field of law, medical care, and other arenas where knowledge has been locked behind exclusive and expensive training programs seems to have a home in Ivan Illichs savage critique of industrial society. In a similar way that schools remove the educational responsibility  (and ability) away from the whole of societry, it seems that other specialized fields remove the agency from other parts of society being able to take responsibilty.

This reminds me of the gripe I had with the myopic focus of the conversations/activism around mental health on Stanford Campus. I always thought that one of the best things on campus for mental health was not expanded CAPS services, but rather the 3 no-questions-asked late days offered by the computer science department.
