# Fleeting Notes vs Permanent Notes

A fundamental component of the [Zettlekasten Method](214_ZettlekastenMethod.md) is taking fleeting notes--the notes we make as we go through our day, listen to a lecture, read a paper-- into **permanent notes**. 

A permanent note is:   
--> A single idea that is fully explained in your own words, using complete sentences.   
--> That includes full citation information

There are a few reasons for this transformation:

1. **Longevity of the note** Creating permanent notes allows the idea we have to not dissapear. While a quick note we jot down will make sense to us for a certain time interval, after a few years, notes that are jotted down in the moment lose their meaning. 
We might remember the keyword, but lose the context or clarity of what exactly a note meant. 

2. **Forces a check for comprehension** Often when we hear or read something, we believe we understand it. It is often not until we go to write it down or carefully explain it to someone else that we realize that there are holes in our understanding, or worse, that the idea doesn't make sense at all. 
By forcing the note taker to write out the idea in full, it provides the note taker a chance to guage how well the information is understood as well as providing an opportunity to return to the source material while it is still close by. 

3. **Ability to then sequence the notes.** Once the note/idea is translated into a permanent note or card, we now heve the incredible ability to connect that note/idea to other notes/ideas. This begins with where it is placed in the zettlekasten (see link below). 

 Once you have a permanent note, you then **[add it to your "slip box"](216_AddingToTheSlipBox.md)** or "zettlekasten"
