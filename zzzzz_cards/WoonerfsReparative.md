# Could Woonerfs be Reparative?

Just a little over a year ago Daunte Wright, a 20-year-old driving down a street in Minneapolis was pulled over by the police for a routine traffic stop. If you were around last year, you know the rest. 


For many of us, the last few years have provided more than enough evidence that the police need to be abolished, or at the very least, defunded. But for many, the resistance to heed calls for abolishing prisons or defunding the police stems not from a disagreement about the role prisons or police place in oppressing black and brown communities, but an inability to fathom what a world without them could look like. One way perhaps that we can tap into this imagination is to think about places and spaces in our society where we already don’t believe that we need policing. For example, imagine a very happy, hyper, young girl running to her younger brother. First imagine her along the edge of a swimming pool, then imagine her running through a wide-open field. In the first example, we can easily imagine the need of a lifeguard telling her to slow-down. However, in the second case, there is no need for her behavior to be controlled. The difference between these two situations is one of terrain. One terrain is treacherous and to be safe, it needs rules, and if it needs rules, it needs rule-enforcers. The other terrain is safe, it does not need rules, and so it does not need rule enforcers. 


In the article Reparative Planning in Action: The Case of Alliance for Community Transit- Los Angeles Song et al describe how the work of the transit advocacy group ACT-LA attempts to “shift the  narrative around transit safety beyond policing” (Song et al, 11).  Part of this work involved the group working with Angelenos to develop a “web of unsafety” that creates an understanding of what makes people feel unsafe—broken elevators, poor lighting, bad smells, long wait times, etc.  (Song, 2022). The argument underlying this work is that deep investment in public transit can create an environment that is safe, not because it is policed, but because it is no longer neglected. And by creating an environment that is “safe,” the need for law-enforcement is hobbled. 


The idea that ACT-LA uses of shifting the safety narrative can also apply to other forms of transit. Imagine a typical residential American street with two-lanes of traffic, broken sidewalks, and a playground. This terrain requires ‘policing’ because it is inherently treacherous. The laws of how fast a car can go is set not by the terrain, but by the imposition of a speed limit, signals such as stop signs and traffic lights, complex licensing and permitting of who is allowed to drive, and safety standards for the vehicles themselves. All entities that, to be effective, likely need to be externally enforced. So what would it mean to think about road safety beyond policing? It could mean redesigning the street in such a way  that the speed and manner by which a car navigates is not set by laws, but instead by the physical terrain. Take for example Woonerfs, the Dutch Street Typology that creates “shared streets’ by eliminating use-distinctions and introducing non-linear paths. These typologies, when implemented correctly, tend to force cars into significantly slower (and thus safer) speeds. Importantly, they also go beyond “traffic calming” measures like speed bumps that only seek to control behavior, as they simultaneously improve the experience of walking, biking and other modes of movement that have been made unpleasant and unsafe by our former city planners  in order to facilitate automotive traffic.


In 2016, while the focus of police violence was still two states away in Ferguson, Missouri, city officials in Minneapolis unveiled the city’s first “Woonerf” at Mill City Corner.  The project was implemented by the developers of Mill City Quarter Apartments and altered a 500 ft road between two much larger streets. I mention this somewhat paltry example of civic improvement to emphasize that I do not believe that ad-hoc woonerf projects will save us. Nor am I trying to say that the only way to end law-enforcement is to remove laws. Instead, what I am trying to argue is that the project to defund the police and abolish prisons is a project of coalition building and advocacy, but it is also a project  of observation and imagination.  In the epilogue to his article What Do We Mean When We Say, “Structural Racism?” Walter Johnson ends his piece with a critique of the response Emerson Electric, a manufacturing company in Ferguson, Missouri had to the Michael Brown protests. In response to the events of the summer surfacing the militarization, state-sponsored segregation and terror facing the community of Ferguson, Emerson Electric launched a run-of-the mill “talent identification” based scholarship that funded  the education of a few youths in the neighborhood. Johnson goes on to write, “The uprising in Ferguson, the outrage and direct action of people in the streets, has provided us with the opportunity to see our times anew. It is up to us to have the presence of mind to seize the moment.”  Emerson Electric by simply giving money to what businesses like Emerson Electric have always given money to was not seizing the moment. Municipal officials by funding the departments that municipal officials have always funded will not be seizing the moment. We need new responses.
