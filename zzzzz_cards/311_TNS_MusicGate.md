Hi all, 

Want to echo again that I think there is a lot of value in a conversation that happens in-person, but since the conversation is happening here I wanted to insert some thoughts on music. 

Starting from my personal experience, one of the things that draws me to the TNS is the music. For me, a huge part of being in community with this group is getting to share the absolute bliss of skating through the city while skating in-and-out of different musical genres. Being able to connect with Sho on a track of Tierra Whack and then roll over to Nevo playing Diana Ross has been such a joy for me. For me the music is a really big part of what I love about these skates.  

Another thing that I really value about TNS is the way that a community of people from all different backgrounds is able to show-up and all be together. For me, **I am really nervous about putting in place any "rules" that attempt to dictate how people show up in this space that are not directly related to keeping us all emotionally and physically safe.** There is so much power involved in who is able to take up space in any given community/location, and I feel that sharing music is an example of how some people choose to celebrate themselves and find their place within a community. One of the things that I love about skating in this group is that it is an activity that at its core is reclaiming space from a culture that has prioritized cars (and the people who can afford to drive them) above everyone else. I feel that taking up auditory space is akin to the physical space our bodies take up on the streets. In the same way that I feel great about reclaiming the right to be in the middle of a street, I feel great about being able to play music in that street.  

I want to acknowledge that while I love hearing music, some people love skating in silence. I have a couple of thoughts on this, but I really want to hear more from this perspective. Some of my beginning thoughts is that it seems relatively easy (for eveyone but the lead and the sweep) to find quieter zones on the skates. I feel like if we find a good way to make sure that we are sharing these responsibilities, this tension point will ease. Another thought that I have is whether or not enforcing silence (or quiet music) on the skates is not akin to someone else playing their music **(it is at its core a similar control of the auditory space).**
