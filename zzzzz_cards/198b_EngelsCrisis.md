# Engels on "Crisis" or "Housing Shortage"

Engels writes about the misleading nature of a "shortage" in the same way that Madden critiques crisis. 

"The so-called housing shortage, which plays such a great role in the
press nowadays, does not consist in the fact that the working class
generally lives in bad, overcrowded or unhealthy dwellings. This
shortage is not something peculiar to the present; it is not even one of
the sufferings peculiar to the modern proletariat in contradistinction to
all earlier oppressed classes. On the contrary, all oppressed classes in
all periods suffered more or less uniformly from it."
