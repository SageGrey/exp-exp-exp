Speed limits are non-scientific numbers that carry limited effectiveness. They generally have only a very loose association with the speed that would make a given road safe.  

**"A speed limit is a number that indicates where you can start getting a ticket. It also has nothing to do with safety or how fast people will drive.  speed limits are not traffic calming, roadway design is"** -Carole Voulgaris discussing the effectiveness of implementing speed limit signs in a lecture on traffic flow modeling in her course Transportation Economics, Fall 2022.
