There are quite a few mountains in New England that non-native americans call Bald Mountain. There's one near my dad's house in Maine.  I love that place, I love the path that winds up to the summit through birch trees and moss. Love themushrooms at the base and the blueberry bushes at the top. But I never quite understood where the name came from. The first time I learned about its name was when I overheard my dad telling the story to my girlfriend. He told her that lightning had struck a tree at the top of the mountain, and that a fire started that burned all the trees within a certain radius of the top. When he was growing up, the mountain would have looked like a big green chia pet with a bald spot.

That fire jumps and spits and cracks and starts and putters does not mean that it is without pattern.
