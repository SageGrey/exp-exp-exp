# No one chooses to fail

If someone is having a hard time, chances are that they are not choosing to struggle. People generally do not want to be unreliable, incompetent, or flaky. If someone sees this behavior and thinks the cause is laziness or apathy, they are likely missing critical details that can explain what is actually happening.
