# Spinning Jenny

Pivotal invention of the Industrial Revolution. Replaced older technology. One machine was capable of doing the work of ~120 spinners. 

Jinny comes from slang for Engine. 

`Remaining Questions:` When I looked up images, I got the individual version not the one that filled up a building. Are there different words for the two machines?
