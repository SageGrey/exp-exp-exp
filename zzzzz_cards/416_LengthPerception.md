On terrain that is more calming, cyclists perceive the distance they must travel as shorter. When they are on rougher or more dangerous terrain, they tend to perceive the distance as longer. 

For example, THIS PERSON HERE found in her research of THIS PLACE that Cycleways (Bike Only Paths) are perceived to be 4% shorter, routes through green areas 7%, and areas near water nearly 20% shorter. Conversely, large roads without designated bike infrastructure were perceived to be 22% longer.
