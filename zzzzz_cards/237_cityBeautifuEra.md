## City Beautiful Era 1870-1900, end of the 19th Century
  
      "Make the city beautiful in the sense in which things 
      have always been beautiful in periods of high culture" -- Ralph Adams Cram

       
Also known as the gilded age (dubbed by Mark Twain), age of enterprise, age of excess. Much of the "city planning" discourse in this era is centered around improving the "public realm." Major actors are the Robber Barron's who talk about an "obligation of wealth." Foremost example being Carnegie building libraries and public institutions. 

Obsession with apperance

     ~CLothes Dont Make the man, but they come close to making the city. 
     --Lawrence Underwood Quote (kinda, didnt get the quote exactly)
     
 Lots of cities get grand civic buildings at this time: examples are as varied as Colorado Springs to Manilla to Cleveland.
 
 ## Chicago: Capital of Capitalism
 
 Huge factors are Sears Roebuck and the Stockyards (500 acres standing as precursor to henry ford's assembly line).
 
 **Fire of 1870** Chicago is able to mobilize back quickly, at one point building 5000 houses in a week.
 
 **1893** Chicago Worlds Columbian Exposition 
 400th Anniversary of the "discovery of america," Daniel Burnham directs the building of the "white city." Among other wonders, had electricity prior to the technology being widely available. Mechanical Sidewalks, Potable Water, Monorail. 
 
 Worlds fair is well documented (first to be heavily photographed) and well atteneded (19 million visitors in 6 months, equivalent to roughly half the population of the US at the time). 
 
 
 ## Building DC
 
City Beautiful Advocates form the Senate Park Commission and revive the century old dream of L'enfants plan for DC. A plan that heavily influenced Haussman's plan for Paris. Burnham then goes to Paris and is inspired in cyclical fashion.

## Building Manila
Burnham goes to Manila to build another civic center there. In very gross colonial fashion it was described as "Lawfull physical loveliness" making the locals "quiet, receptive, and happy."

## Plan of Chicago 1909
Adopted, enormously influential and ambitious plan. Focused on public realm. Burnham did not see the role of plan as interfering with private realm, like housing.
1. Lakefront Parks
2. Highway system
3. Rail improvements
4. Systematic arrangement of streets (with diagonals inspired by Paris, L'enfant)
5. Civic + Cultural Centers

In this plan Burnham is not neccesarily departing from the Parks movement, but he does have different aesthetic sensibilities. 

## Late 19th Century - 1890s  
Beginning of the Reform Movement (Jane Addams), belief that inequality matters. The reformers are criticizing the city beautiful's sole focus on public spaces.
