# Pleasure Planning: 
### What American cities could learn from sex-positive education. 

It is almost easier to name what you cannot do in public spaces in the United States than it is to name what you can do. You cannot drink, you cannot play loud music, you cannot sell food, you cannot take recreational drugs, you cannot skateboard, you cannot sell wares, you cannot play with your dog off-leash, you cannot pitch a tent, you cannot nap, you cannot hang a hammock. What can you do? You can play oversized chess. 

In her opening remarks decrying the state of planning in the Death and Life of Great American Cities, Jane Jacobs writes about contemporary projects that planners have made describing them as “marvels of dullness and regimentation, sealed against any buoyancy or vitality of city life…civic centers that are avoided by everyone, but bums, who have fewer choices of loitering places than others (62, Jacobs)”  This critique builds to her larger point that there is a tremendous folly in the way that planners are approaching their work, instead of learning from places where cities are vibrant and thriving such as The South End in Boston or Morningside Heights in NYC, they are relying on expertise. 

The field of Urban Planning has changed quite a bit since Jacobs wrote Great American Cities. Top-down planning of Robert Moses, urban renewal, and highway expansion have shifted towards “communicative planning” approaches that seek to involve community input. But even while these changes (that presumably, Jacobs would have supported) have shifted, critiques of planners creating sterile, lifeless environments remain. I argue that one reason we continue this creation of lackluster space is that we have not sufficiently taken up Jacob’s challenge to learn from cites as “laboratories of trial and error” where  “failure and success in city building and city design(63, Jacobs)”  is made apparent. Instead, we rely on digital renderings and “theories about cities (Jacobs, 66).”

I believe one of the “theories about cities” that damages our ability to create thriving public spaces is the assumption that activities with the potential to bother others are nuisances, that they are not critical, and that public space is improved when they are banned. This manner of handling potential harm by prohibiting it is essentially the civic equivalent of an abstinence-only sex education curriculum. We take a pleasurable activity that has inherent risks, but instead of attempting to manage the risks, we attempt to prevent the behavior entirely. Like abstinence, this method is deeply flawed. First, people are probably going to do the pleasurable thing anyway, and if they do, they will be approaching it already in the mindset of a “transgressor.” And secondly, pleasure is critically important to thriving. 

As far as form goes, Redwood City Plaza (Redwood City, CA) and Parque México (Mexico City) are remarkably similar places. Redwood City Plaza was recently upgraded as part of a municipal planning project in the last decade (CDP, 2014) and Parque Mexico was renovated in 2008 (GCDMX, 2015). Both have a grand, sprawling paved area with water features, well-maintained planters, and plenty of places to sit. Both are near high-density, mixed-income residential neighborhoods. However, one is an uncomfortable wasteland and one is a beloved cultural hub. In Parque México, there are skateboarders grinding on railings, numerous vendors hawking food, dancers moving to loud music, men sitting on ledges drinking, dogs off leashes, kids kicking soccer balls, and teenagers smoking. In Redwood City, there is a singular office worker squinting at a laptop.
 I am not trying to argue that what makes Parque Mexico a successful public space is exclusively its permissiveness to behaviors that are traditionally prohibited in the US. But I do want to point out that many of the things that are bringing people pleasure in Parque Mexico  are things that are prohibited in American Parks. Looking at diverse groups of folks enjoying the park at golden hour, it is hard to justify any of those activities as anti-social or deviant. This then poses the question, where do our beliefs about what behaviors are acceptable come from? What is shaping our understanding of how a plaza should be used? Do these assumptions and attitudes, like assumptions about sex and sexuality, come from experience, or from what was modeled/taught to us?
