# Metaphors of Office Culture 

Something that I find amusing (bemusing?) about digital storage:

Computers are infinitely adaptable, we could have had anything, and yet somehow the [conceptual metaphors](https://github.com/SageGrey/exp-exp-exp/blob/main/zzzzz_cards/208_LakoffandJohnson.md) we ended up with are filing cabinets and 80s/90s [office culture](https://youtu.be/UbxUSsFXYo4)?!?

I find this irksome for a couple of reasons: 

1. **It grounds digital life** very squarely into language that I associate with coorporate offices and the goals of an efficient, money-making enterprise. The associations that I have with "Files and Folders and Desk(tops)" are all those of an office space--->graphs showing quarterly profits, clip-art of conference rooms, flourescent lighting, accounting spreadsheets. As a society we kept track of objects for thousands of years before the manilla file folder, we could have gone with the language of a printer, librarian, train conductor, carpenter etc. 

2. **It collapses spatial relations.** You aren't required to know where in space a piece of paper is inside of filing cabinet. It could be near the front, it could be near the back--it doesn't matter that you remember where it is in order to find it. Filing cabinets give us a way to think about where something is based on a system/order (such as alphabetical/temporal) instead of where it is in space. This is a cool facet, HOWEVER, the flip side of this is that if the system in place has broken down--if the system has been forgotten or altered there are very few handolds that the mind can use to jog memory as to where something may be. Perhaps because we never made spatial memories because we thought we wouldn't need them.
