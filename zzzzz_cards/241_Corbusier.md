# Half-Baked Tech Bro Before his Time, Le Corbusier

### General Notes
Is a pretty good architect, but imho a garbage urban planner who relies on a massive oversimplification of humanity. Has a version of urban planning that essentially places the role of the planner as part of an authoritarian, capitalistic state. To try to get his ideas implemented, he went to authoritarian governments. He was able to have his 1925 plan of Paris funded by the car company Voisin.  Held the belief that "Revolution can be avoided." His glasses become popular with architects. 

One justification for studying this kid is because for better or worse his ideas influenced urban planning, the modernists give urban planning the language of the "machine age." And firmly establishes a "spatial co-relative of capitalism." Given that his plans require massive destruction of what already exists, Le Corbusier puts forward a vision of planning that is tied with the power of the state. 

### Villa Citrohan and Immueble Villas
These renderings actually seem somewhat cool in isolation. The general idea was that the industrialized notion of typification could apply to housing. The house could be seen as a machine in service to its inhabitants. Also relied on the idea that like cars, houses could evolve into their ideal form.  The Villa Citrohan, or the universal dwelling, are notable for a few reasons documented below.
1. Concrete Frame with inset beams. Meant that the interior walls were not load bearing and could be reconfigured to suit needs
2. Double height living room. 
3. Roof Terrace
4. Raised on pillars. Detaches the house from "place" means that a house could be built the same regardless of where, including in a river.

The Villas would come together to form the Immueble Villas (apartment complexes essentially).

### Unbelievably, Chandigahr

Independent elites in India embrace Le Corbusier's ideas and to celebrate their self-determination as a new nation build a place that is unsuited to the climate or people.
