# Schooling of The Imagination (reliance on institutions, learning on ones own unreliable)

In his explanation of what it means for a society or a mind to be schooled, Illich hints that it resides in the idea that we become reliant in schools and institutions by no longer believing independent alternatives as trustworthy. 

"Not only education but social reality itself has become schooled...Rich and poor alike depend on schools and hospitals which guide their lives, form their world view, and define for them what is legitmate and what is not. Both view doctoring oneself as irresponsible, learning on one's own ass unreliable, and community organization, when not paid for by those in authority, as a form of aggression and subversion. For both groups the reliance on institutional treatment renders independent accomplishment suspect.
