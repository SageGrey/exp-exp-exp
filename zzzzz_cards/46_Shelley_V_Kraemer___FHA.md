# Shelley V Kraemer & FHA

Shelley V Kraemer case ruled that while individual descrimination in who to sell your home to was fine, you could not use the courts (ie the state) to enforce this segregation. People could segregate, but the courts could not be involved. By this logic, the FHA should have had to ammend their pushing of racially restricitve covenants and neighborhood associations, but the FHA resisted the change.
