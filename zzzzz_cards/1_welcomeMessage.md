# A few notes before we begin the show

Folx and Friends, welcome to the Lobo Theater!  
I am so honored to invite you to this space, and I am overjoyed that you are here reading these words. 

I created this space because I wanted to explore the infrastructre of digital storage and traditional "organization" tools through the lens of my ongoing attempts to liberate myself from them. By trying to circumvent the tools I have used since childhood, I hope to find a patch of grass where I can roll out a blanket, pop open a beer, and gaze back at where I started. 

In the past few months of experimenting with alternative ways of doing the mundane, I have stumbled on ideas that have brought me a lot of joy.
I doubt that the resonance that I have felt with most of these ideas will be universal, but if there is something that does, I would love to hear about it. 
You can contact me by submitting an issue. 

-Happy Friday, 
Sage
