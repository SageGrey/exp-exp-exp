When drivers get used to seeing cyclists everywhere, they're much less likely to hit them. Other factors (such as [protected bike lanes](http://www.vox.com/2014/6/5/5782472/study-bike-lanes-really-do-increase-biking)) are definitely important, but bike helmets can't replicate the "safety in numbers" effect in making biking safer — any more than bulletproof vests can reduce gun violence.
