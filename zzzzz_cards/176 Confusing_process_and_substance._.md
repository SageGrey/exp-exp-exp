# Confusing process and substance. 

Ivan Illicich begins his series of essays in deschooling society with the following proclamation.

 "Many students, especially those who are poor, intuitively know what the schools do for them. they school them to confuse process and substance. Once these become blurred, a new logic is assumed: the more treatment there is, the better are the results; or, escalation leads to success. The pupil is therby "schooled" to confuse teaching with learning, grade advancement with education, a diploma with competnece, and fluency with the ability to say something new. His imagination is "schooled" to accept service in place of value. Medical treatment is mistaken for health care, social work for improvemnt of community life, police protection for safety, military poise for national security, the rat race for productive work. Helath, learning, dignity, independence and creative endeavor are defined as little more than the performance of the institutions which claim to serve these ends, and their improvement is made to depend on allocating more resources to the management of hospitals, schools and other agencies in question."

Illich goes on to remark that this institutionilization of values leds inevitably to physical pollution, social polarization and psycological impotence. And this degredation is accelerated when nonmaterial needs are transformed into demands for commodities. ie "when health, education, personal mobility, welfare or psycological healing are defined as the result of services or "treatments."
