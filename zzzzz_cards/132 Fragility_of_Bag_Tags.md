# Fragility of Bag Tags

I want to tell the next generation about filling out a bag tag at an airport, and the system we had designed for luggage that relied on a fleeting piece of paper attached by the smallest and flimsiest white elastic band. How this system was a human way to help us catch what fell through the cracks  (and we knew that invariably there would be cracks) of the more formal system. 

I want to tell them about the transition when we stopped putting our address, realizing that a name and phone number was enough (Cell-Phones really changed the game). I want to tell them about all the sophisticated or funny bag tags that you could buy.

This was inspired by a laminated yellow bag tag that was attached to a suitcase I brought in from the alley. The address is L.S Rosenberg PO BX 3596 Rancho Santa Fe, Ca 92067 858-945-3600. On the back is a laminated drawing of a greek woman in a flower petal gown.
