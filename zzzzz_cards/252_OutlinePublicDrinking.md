# Public Drinking Paper Outline


Introduction: 

#### Introduction
* Story About Public Drinking (Beer and Dogs) 
* **ARGUMMENT** In this paper, I argue that legal efforts to shape public drinking behavior have never really been about alcohol. Instead, they are efforts to control what happens in public spaces. Drinking laws reveal the normative values and desires of a given time period's power brokers, values, and desires that also appear in a given time period's urban planning.  In this paper, I wish to look at three periods of American History in which rules around drinking and urban planning changed in tandem. These are industrialization, disinvestment/white flight, and privatization. In discussing the legal history and urban planning history of these three historical moments together, I hope to argue that while public drinking rules affect everybody, their intended audience has always been society's most disenfranchised.
