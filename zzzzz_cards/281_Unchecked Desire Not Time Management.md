# Unchecked Desire Not Time Management
Created: Jul-03-2022

It occured to me recenty that the difficulty that I was having in following through on developing skills, such as dedicating time each day to practicing spanish, drawing, or skating, did not stem so much from a problem with time management or self-discipline, but rather from an unchecked desire of what I wanted from myself. I was not succeeding in the mandate to [282_desire as little as possible, be at grateful as you can](282_desire%20as%20little%20as%20possible,%20be%20at%20grateful%20as%20you%20can.md) when it applied to what I wanted from myself.
