A study that does not bode well for us. 
A study run by David Halpern required a group of volunteers and architecture students were shown a series of photos of faces and buildings and asked to rate the attractiveness of the subject. The group showed similarity in ranking the faces, but the longer that respondants had studied architecture, the more their response diverged from the group as a whole. (Habtour, 100)
