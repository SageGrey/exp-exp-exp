# Strength in Numbers

The first time I skated with the group in Boston, a girl named Joy skated next to me. When she saw my reaction to the group skating taking up a full lane on the Anderson Memorial Bridge, she gleefully said to me, "what are the car going to do, hit all of us?" Wheras one of us alone wouldn't dare skate down the center of a major thoroughfare during peak hours, a group of 10+ can. With a big enough group, the cars wait. With a big enough group, the cars re-negotiate the road, learning to treat  wheeled-pedestrians like they would a large city-bus. 

Ocassionaly there is push-back, a car horn or a rolled-down window will indicate displeasure--but for the most part--this renegotiation is accepted in the same way that an orange-cone can change traffic flows. 


# Pro-Social, Anti-Stop Behavior 
Being able to "ride-out" a hill (ie not use your breaks while going downhill) is one of the great pleasures of skating. While there is virtually no safe way to do this individually in a city like Boston, when skating with an organizm there is a simple solution. Someone towards the beginning of the hill will stop at the intersection, then position their body between where the cars would come and the path of the other skaters. This is most common on hills, but also can happen at other intersections along a route. While there are a few specific roles in a skate for example a lead (sets the route) and a sweep (skates at the back of the pack, make sure no one gets left behind). The majority of the behavior that allows for the skates to take over the streets can be described as  favors to other skaters

# Music 
One way that I've heard the Night Skates described is a house party that moves. The guests arrive over a span of ~30 minutes, someone tries (often semi-succesfully) to get everyone into a photo, and then they go.


Not everyone is there to mingle
