The gulf between the financial compensation for incarcerated and free fire-fighters is dramatic. The mean salary for a California firefighter is $74,000 (DeomcracyNow, 2018), meanwhile prison firefighters are paid $2.56 a day with a bonus of $1 an hour when deployed to an active fire (Lowe, 2021). This rate "saves" the state of California an estimated 80-100 million dollars annualy. (DemocracyNow, 2018)
