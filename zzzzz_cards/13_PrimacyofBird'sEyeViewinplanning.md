# Primacy of Bird's Eye View in planning

 An aerial view of the city is so unlike how someone familiar with an area perceives it. Wondering what a planning document that de-emphasizes maps from above would look like.

**Thoughts**
Sitting in a preterm workshop it was interesting to think about how little I conceived of Albuquerque or Chicago from an overhead view, wondering how much this default will change as I immerse myself more and more into urban planning world. 
I'm Imagining a diagram of albuquerque that uses elevations at a slight tilt instead of overhead views.
