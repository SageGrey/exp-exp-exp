# Positive Financial Leverage
When a company/individual borrows funds and then invests these funds at an interest rate that is higher than the interest they are paying on the loan. 


Examples:   
If a company borrows money for a real estate development and the profit exceeds the debt service payments. 
----> `I dont understand this yet` If ROE (Return on Investment) is greater than Return on Total Assets (ROTA), you have positive financial leverage.
