# Le Courbousier and Jenny Odell 

It is little suprise that [z 162]Le Corbusier[/z], an urban planner that was enchanted by the hyerarchical structures of capitalism made possible by the machine age and that [z 163]Jenny Odell[/z], an artist disillusioned with 21st century capitalism would disagreed about some things, but the fact that they have diametrically opposite views on the importance of place seems notable. Points to a deeper connection between lack of specificity of land and capitalistic growth.

Le Corbusier designed a city for Moscow that a few years later he proposed for paris with minimal changes.
