# Lily Song THEY BLAMED THE PEOPLE

In a lecture where Lily Song introduced the advocacy organization Act-Up LA, she described the context that this organization was responding against. Song's premise was that LA, like many other cities across the country, first disinvested from maintaining civic infrastructure like transit, then, instead of assuming blame for the deterioriating conditions resulting from this systemic disinvestment, they created skapegoats that they said were to blame for the conditions of these places. The villans of these stories were not municiple officials, but skateboarders or unhoused folks. This shifting of blame has clear parallels to other instances of blame shifting such as the Keep America Beautiful campaign.
