Blue Bikes currently has a strategy for dealing with high-traffic stations through their BlueBike Valet service. These are stations where a staff member is stationed at a site with a and has the ability to put bikes into a van (or take them out) freeing up extra docks or providing extra bikes. "Valet service" is predominantly deployed on a Monday-Friday basis for managing "rush hour" usage. It is not readily obvious how often it is deployed for "pleasurable" events where high-demand is also needed. 


>**Questions I have**: 
> * What is the experience of staff members at these sites? 
> * Does a valet service always use a van? 
> * How often are they deployed
> * Is there a record of how often they've been deployed? 
> * What does the total labor cost?
