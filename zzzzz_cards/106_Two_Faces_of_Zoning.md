The two faces of zoning during the period following [Buchanan](104_Buchanan_V_Warley_1917.md) are to first exclude african americans from certain neighborhoods, and then, make sure that the white neighborhoods are superior and better maintained than the black neighborhoods through tools such as: locations of polluting industries and waste facilities, allowing subdividing in red lined neighborhoods, allowing bars/taverns/prostitution establishments.
