# Invention of New Classes of Poor

If we start to see access to an institution and services rendered by professionals of that sector as essential to achieving some outcome such as health or education, then we create an opportunity for a new definitions of poverty and exclusion. Illich describes this phenomenon, "once basic needs have been translated by a sociery into demands for scientifically produced commodities, pocerty is defined by standards which the technocrats can change at will. Poverty then refers ro those who have fallen behind an advertised ideal of consumption in some important respect. In Mexico the poor are those who lack three years of schooling, and in New York they are those who lack twelve"
