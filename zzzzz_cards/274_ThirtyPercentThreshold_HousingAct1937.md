# 30% AMI & Housing Act of 1937
The housing act of 1937. Created pubic housing that wa state owned, where ownership and operation would be run by government. This housing was conditioned on a 1:1 basis, so it did not really increase the quanitity of public housing. An interesting lasting impact of the act is that it establishes the 30% rent burden threshold.
