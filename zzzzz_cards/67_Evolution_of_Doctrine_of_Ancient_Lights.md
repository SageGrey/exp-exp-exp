# Evolution of Doctrine of Ancient Lights

Europe tended to have Doctrine of Ancient lights, however, when the United States began their legal code there was a much more rigorous pro-growth mindset. However it is not that consistent, for example, in [ Prah v. Maretti](63_Prah_V._Maretti%20)  they do apply Doctrine of Ancient Rights to indicate that Maretti has limits to where he can build his house.
