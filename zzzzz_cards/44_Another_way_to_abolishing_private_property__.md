# Another way to abolishing private property? 

With the idea that private property is signed by the citizen and enforced by the state (Cohens), is there a way that instead of "abolishing private property" there could simply be a reduction in the extent to which the state provides resources to enforce. ie You could enforce your own private property rights but the state does not promise to help you protect those rights?
