# Pro Forma Components

_note about formatting + [accounting conventions](https://github.com/SageGrey/exp-exp-exp/blob/main/zzzzz_cards/204_accountingFormatting.md)_ 

      --> lines indicate addition and subtraction of preceding rows (sometimes looks like an underlined word)
      --> (parentheses) indicate negative values  
      --> dots in this forma are simply to indicate indentation (markdown constraint)
      --> Bold indicates key cash flows in
