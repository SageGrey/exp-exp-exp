Before the slogan "Remember--only you can prevent forest fires" was the phrase "Another Enemy to Conquer: Forest Fires." In February 1942, less than three months after Pearl Harbor, a Japanese submarine shelled an oil field off the coast of Santa Barbara. While the Ellwood Oil Field attack caused minimal damage, it stireed the public fears about war on the homefront. The attack was regarded "as the first attack on the US mainland by a hostile nation since the sack of Washington D.C in the War of 1812." The shelling, which occurred near Los Padres National Forest, helped to trigger an association of warfare with forest fires within the American consciousness. Shortly after the shelling, the War Advertising Council and the U.S. Forest Service collaborated to launch a campaign that would cement this association. Posters from this effort are striking. Perhaps one of the most uncomfortable of this series of posters is this one where a caricatured Hideki Tojo and Adolf Hitler appear in the foreground of a forest fire with the slogan, "OUR CARELESSNESS Their Secret Weapon, PREVENT FOREST FIRES."

 The following year, the ad campaign took a sharp aesthetic turn and borrowed the license to Bambi from Disney. Leaving the aesthetic of fear, the collaboration turned to favorable feelings of animals in the forest.  Noticing the public reaction to a big-eyed cartoon, the campaign developed their own character, and in August 1944 released Smokey The Bear with the tagline "Care will prevent 9 out of 10 fires." Two years later, the bear with a hat and dungarees got his more memorable slogan, "Only you can prevent fire."

The mascot Smokey The Bear developed remarkable staying power, becoming an iconic staple of wilderness across the United States. With Smokey at the helm, the US Forest Service began to radically change the pattern of fire in wildlands. Between 1930-1950s, the service reduced the average annual number of wildfires by 40,000 a year.  This successful suppression of fire is accompanied by the sucessful instillation of the belief that all forest fire is bad, and that our patriotic responsibility as citizens of the United States is to stop them.
