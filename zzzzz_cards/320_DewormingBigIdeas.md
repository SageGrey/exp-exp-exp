# Worm Wars

Deworming initiatives took off globally during the past 20 years. Spurred by forces like the World Health 0rganization and GiveWell, nations across the globe launched massive deworming initiatives that would give prophylactic doses of deworming pills to school aged children. These initiatives were inspired by a 2004 paper by Michael Kremer and Edward Miguel that documented a study conducted in Kenya that showed that deworming pills had a massive benefit to school attendance and health, not just in the schools where the program was administered, but to nearby schools as well. However, further investigation of this study in 2015 revealed substantial flaws. In addition to numerous other studies prior to the 2004 study that had looked at deworming initiatives, it became clear that the science behind the deworming campaigns was far shakier than the "Ted-talk industrial complex" had implied.  

One take-away from this story is that it reveals what Michael Hobbs and Aubrey Gordon describe as two toxic and insatiable desires. One is the desire for "get rich quick" schemes or "big ideas", especially  ones that come from an unexpected source similar to "this one weird trick." The other desire is the urge to, as an outsider, fix someone else's problem and show that you were able to do something that they were not.  These desires explain in part the ability for otherwise intelligent people to crowd towards bad ideas.
