# Ask WHY I dont feel good here

When discussing physical spaces Mitchel Silver brought up his practice of noticing when he doesn't feel good in a physical space, and then attempting to bring his attention to *why* he may be feeling that way. 

### Comments
Feels similar to Uta Hagens questions of Why am I here, What do I want, What Am I going to do to get what I want. Or Prokopiaks idea to use bad feeligns for acting resevoir.
