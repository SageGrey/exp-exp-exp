# Conceptual Metaphors

In their 1980 work _Metaphors We Live By_ George Lakoff and Mark Johnson outlined their theory that metaphors are a tool that the mind uses to understand abstract concepts. 

They noted that--for what had genereally been thought of as a mere linguistic device--metaphors tended to be remarkably consistent and uni-directional.
For their point about consistency, they pointed out that abstract concepts were associated with similar metaphors: metaphors around morality largely dealt with cleanliness  _(they had a clean concience, he was slimey)_, metaphors around understanding tended to deal with vision/sight _(they were in the dark, her understanding was fuzzy)._ 
For their point about uni-directional they pointed out that metaphors between abstract and concrete concepts always use the concrete to explain the abstract.  

Sometimes known as a cognitive metaphor, the theory is that conceptual metaphors not only shape how we understand abstact concepts, but also mold our understanding without us conciously realizing that the concrete is influencing our understanding of the abstract. 


#### Notes
seems like there might be some pushback starting with some of the early work, maybe [read this](https://www-sciencedirect-com.ezp-prod1.hul.harvard.edu/science/article/pii/S0271530906000176) or do more research before you put this note in something formal
