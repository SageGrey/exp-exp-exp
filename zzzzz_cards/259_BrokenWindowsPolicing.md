## Broken Window Policing

The theory generated by an infamous 1982 Atlantic article written by social scientists James Q. Wilson and Geogre L. Kelling. The article, "The Police and Neighborhood Safety" argued that police departments should clamp-down on petty crime such as panhandling, loitering, grafitti, and prostitution in order to prevent serious crime. The argument rested on a notoriously bizarre mischarecertization of a social experiment Philip Zimbardo (the semi-disgraced sociologist best known for the Stanford Prison Projcet) did to prompt property desctuction (Ansfield, 2019) and a now-thoroughly debunked analysis that proposed a causal connection between visual indications of illegal activity or "disorder" with heightened crime risk (O'Brian et al, 2019). 

The theory of Broken Windows was popularized in the 1990s by the NYC police comissioner William Bratton and then mayor Rudy Giuliani. Police forces across the country followed suit with "zero tolerance" or similar "tough on crime" policies.
