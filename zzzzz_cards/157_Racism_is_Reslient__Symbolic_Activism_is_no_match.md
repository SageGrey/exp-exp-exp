# Racism is Reslient: Symbolic Activism is no match

Brands/companies/institutions in the wake of George Floyd are often criticized for altering their language or small pockets of visible leaders without making meaningful change. The past shows real danger of symbolic or small change that do not create fundamantal change.

For example. When outright descrimination in housing was banned by the federal government (symbolic victory) we saw the country channeling energy into  [z 105] Single Family[/z] districts which perpetuated the harm, but through more subtle means. The racism outpaced the modest achievement and made the problem harded to solve. 

Sublte racism is often harder to spot (and therefor erradicate).

Would love to know the extent to which fed gov banning housing descrimination was symbolic.
