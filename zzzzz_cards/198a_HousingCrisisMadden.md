# "Housing Crisis" in 2008

Associate sociology professor at the london school of Economics, David Madden discusses this issue in reference to the 2008 housing crisis saying, 

"The idea of crisis implies that inadequate or unaffordable housing is abnormal, a temporary departure from a well-functioning standard. But for
working-class and poor communities, housing crisis is the norm. Insufficient housing has been the mark of dominated groups throughout
history. He then goes on to quote [Engels](198b_EngelsCrisis.md).
