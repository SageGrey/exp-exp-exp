Historical records muse that one of the key injustices that led to Pueblo Revolt of 1680--
the uprising where Ohkay Owingeh leader, Pop√©  led a region-wide attack that drove Spanish settlers out of New Mexico for 12 years--was the burning of their ceremonial masks, prayer sticks, and kachinas (effegies).  During the pueblo revolt, the only succesful uprising of a native community against a colonial power in North America, the religious art of the Spanish Settlers was all destroyed. 

To have fire is to have fuel. What is available to burn. What have we made that can be lost.
