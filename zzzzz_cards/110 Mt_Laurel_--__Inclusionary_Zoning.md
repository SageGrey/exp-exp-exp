# Mt Laurel --> Inclusionary Zoning

Mt Laurel Case â†’ Tackeled Exclusionary Zoning in New Jersey. Argued on basis of rights granted by the state (not federal) constitution. Used the state's guarantee of Due Process and Equal Protection (esp interesting since these words are not in the NJ constitution).

Mt laurel was a beacon of hope for affordable housing advocates, but it has not been replicated by any other state. 

Key principles: 
Every developing municipality myst by it's land use regulation legislation must make realistically possible a variety of housing options for low and moderate income. They must take fair share (regionally) and consider present and prospective needs.
