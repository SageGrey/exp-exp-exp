# Gregarious vs Neighborly

Olmstead defines two broad categories of public spaces as "Greagrious" and "Neighborly." Gregarious refers to the kind of spaces that cities can create with massive crowds and pulsing energy. An example would be a boulevard on parade day.  While he is not neccesarily knocking the concept of "Gregarious" spaces, he is also advocating for another, smaller "neighborly" kind. Neighborly is a public space that while public, doesn't sublimated the individual.
