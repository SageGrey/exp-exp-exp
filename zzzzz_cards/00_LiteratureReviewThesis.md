# and an Alternative Structure for Academic Research

## Arguments


**Arguments/Chapters:**

**Could Wunerfs be an example of Abolitionist Urban Planning**

**Basic Argument:** Wunerfs, the dutch street typology that gets rid of clear "use distinctions" and creates shared streets, could create an urban form that lessens the need for traffic policing. If the speed and manner with which a car moves through space is primarily enforced not by "traffic laws" but by terrain, we would lessen the need for policing along those paths. We dont think of pedestrians and bicyclists as public safety threats, Wunerfs point to a way that streets could be designed so that cars aren't either. If conduct is set by the environment, we dont need rules, and they don't need to be policied. 
               **Counter Argument:** Wouldn't Speed Bumps Achieve This? No, because they don't go far enough and meerly inconvenience, not reshape the terrain. 
               **Counter Argument:** How is controlling cars through environment different than something like hostile architecture that prevents unhoused individuals from lying down on a public bench? I think its different because you are using it to combat power. A car by virtue of being a potential threat depending on how it is driven is meaningfully different than someone who is trying to take a nap. 
               **Counter Argument** Wouldn't you need policing the second you leave a wunerf street? Make all the streets wunerfs. Kidding. But yes, I dont think wunerfs can single-handedly solve the issue of how we eliminate police, but I think they point to a direction. Other examples are (elevating bicycle lanes, yellow line). I can imagine a world

 How would redesigning streets help the problem?
 
 There is a history of roads and streets designed to promote safety without human enforcers. As a historic example, before the right-side-of-the-road norm was established, it caused confusion which side people should drive on. One approach was to lay down the law with human enforcers, but it turned out that just painting a yellow line did a much better job. So engineers and transportation officials could think about designing better without human enforcers. As a more contemporary example, New York City has put up raised medians to encourage more biking and keep cyclists safe by keeping bike lanes separate from traffic lanes. 
               
     
Ultimately, removing policing from traffic enforcement seems to ram up against the way we’ve built the environment to make people rely on cars. Are there other ways around those barriers?

I think there are two answers. One, if we get to fully automated, self-driving cars that are programmed not to violate traffic laws, that would end pretextual traffic stops. So that is one possibility. The other is reimagining how cities are built to rely less on cars and design so that people don’t have to think about whether they are obeying the law or not. I’ve love to see more conversations between urban designers, transportation policy experts and legal scholars to think about how to design urban space so that we can be safe without having to be conscious about acting in compliance with safety laws. That would be really exciting.

     --- Pleasure Positivity, What can urban planners learn from sex-educators. 




### Pleasure Mapping



### Production Culture
Two weeks ago around fifteen MUPs sat on the floor of 7 Sumner. The group was coming together after having broken off into small discussion groups as part of a student-led design charette to discuss frustrations with MUP Core Studio. After a representative from each group had presented takeaways from their presvious disucssions, someone offered a topic for discussion that had come through the critiques. *Production Culture*. The idea was that what we were contending with is a culture at the GSD (and in society generally) that has chosen to prioritize deliverables over learning. Instead of the core of our education being in service to our desired learning outcomes, we felt that our learning was being treated as a secondary objective in the process to create tangible deliverables. 

This idea of Production Culture has stuck with me over the last few weeks. In this assignment, I want to think about how Production Culture applies to the MUP thesis process I am about to begin. 


### Objectives
Ways that a masters thesis can be considered a success  

     1. It wins academic awards
     2. It is published in a journal 
     3. It is cited by other academics
     4. It helps the writer get into a phD program (or other job)
     5. The writer spent a lot of time thinking about exactly what they want to think about
     6. The writer learns something they care about while writing it


### Pitfalls

      1. A process where you write your argument, then search for materials that support your argument
      2. A process where you get stuck writing about something that doesn't interest you.

I argue that the thesis itself is a relic of productivity culture. Research must be built around a deliverable object. 

I pose for this class. A class on experimental infrastructure a alternative to a literature review. 
Instead of identifying the sources I want to read to 

My belief is that if I identify who I want my teachers to be, the arguments and connections will emerge from there. 

Radical Situatedness: 
What do I want my education to be. 


The way that I want to frame this literature analysis is not

Critique is not:

Problem is that when time is crunched, what is sacrificed is not specifications of the deliverable, but the intentionality and thought 

My contention is this:
