## Experimental Infrastructure for Academic Research 
**_Not your grandma's thesis research process_**

Hi Abby! Thank you so much for this class.   

Getting to hang out with the ideas of the course and converse every week has been so wonderful and has made me grateful to be in this program. What I decided to create for the final project is essentially a **summer syllabus** for the research I want to do for my thesis and some **idea mapping** on the topic of pleasure and urban planning. 

I framed this project as a syllabus because I thought it would be a playful way for me to explore my understanded of what I want for this project---self-directed, excitement-led, in-the moment, exploration---as opposed to what I am familliar with---a series of assignments, activities, and readings planned in advance that seek to motivate (discipline?) the student into a well-balaced journey. I am trying to make a sef-directed syllabus that is not just self-directed in that I made it. But also self-directed in that there is minimal attempts to shape what the learning looks like. The "self" I want to be directing the learning is the "self" that exists in the present tense. I want the "self" that is the recipient of the syllabus to set the course, not the "self" that is the syllabus creator. In essence, I see this syllabus as an attempt to do **trip preparation** instead of **trip planning[^1]** I am attempting to organize the tools in my backpack, learn about the route, and think about my intentions. 

At the same time, I want to use the syllabus as a starting point because I want to channel the rigor that a syllabus implies. I don't want to simply dabble, I want to take seriously the chance to "study those who inspire you.[^2]"

Open to any kind of feedback, but one big question I have on my mind: How do you keep motivated/focused on academic work or amorphous work (with or without externalized deadlines)? 

I'm realizing that there might be a lot of text here compared to a paper. I was imagining that you would glance through this syllabus for +/- the same amount of time that you spend on other final projects. 

Best regards + good luck with the end of the semester!

## Syllabus SES 5381: Urban Planning + Pleasure 

<details> 
<summary> 1. Goals of The Class + Assumptions </summary>
  
## Broad Objectives
 
 1. Read writers across a variety of disciplines who have inspired me. 
 2. Generate a body of "permanent notes" that discuss ideas from works I have read
 3. Cultivate enthousiasm for my proposed thesis topic
 4. Learn about pleasure
 
## Secondary Objectives 
 
 1. Develop a "topic" or "reasearch question" that could be used for a Masters Thesis
 2. Be able to speak knowledgably about writers I admire
 3. Learn more about strategies to stay motivated/dedicated through an amorphous project
 
## Assumptions
 1. I will try to work on this project for ~75% of the summer. Summer is 15 weeks, so the project will cover around **11 weeks**
 2. I don't wish to set expectations of time, but I imagine trying to make at **least 4 hours** a week for the project.

  <summary> 2. Subject Matter of The Course: Pleasure </summary>
 
 .. 
This summer course will be an exploration of P L E A S U R E. I'm interested in thinking about pleasure as a political act of liberation taking notes from work such as Audre Lorde's _Erotic As Power_ and Adriene Maree Brown's _Pleasure Activism_. 
  
  ### Some questions that are kicking-off this exploration of pleasure 
  * What are conditions for equitable pleasure (prison abolition, surveillance, policing)?
  * What can planners learn from sex educators? Can we move away from abstinence-only approaches to public drinking, skateboarding, napping, camping, psychadelic drugs, etc.?
  * What is the relationship between pleasure and growth, denied pleasure and development? 
  * How to make the case that pleasure is important and shouldnt be written off the second there is a potential for a lawsuit?
  * What makes a place pleasurable? What are different "triggers" for feeling pleasure? Are these treated seriously in newly designed projects? 
  * Men gets sports fields, where are spaces dedicated for women/femine pleasure?
  * How do subcultures make room for pleasure?

 <summary> 4. Assignments + Tools </summary>
 
In additions to tackling readings, this project will be combined with me exploring and using my own version of the Zettlekasten Method. 
 
### Weekly Assignments
By Monday 1:30pm of each week, the assignment for this course will be to:
 * 1. have made **3 permanent notes** based on the prior week's readings
 * 2. have **added the citation information** for that week's reading notes
 * 3. have **re-read last week's notes** and play with them in obsidian  
  
### Final Project
  * 1. Remake the terrain map to reflect the reading/path I took
 
I see these three weekly tasks as a fairly low bar. The idea is that this is the floor, and that ideally I would end up doing more most weeks. I have set them at a level that I hopefully will not feel shame for not being able to hit a lofty goal, but also would result in 33 permanent notes (which is decently substantial). 
 
  ### 3 Weekly Assignment Components
 <details> 
  <summary> 1. What are permanent notes? </summary>
 
  Permanent notes are part of the Zettlekasten method. A method of thinking, writing and notetaking developed by the the prolific 20th-century German Sociologist Niklas Luhmann (1927-1988).  Luhmann's sytem which employed the clever use of a "slip box" is documented in his own writing, "[Kommunikation mit Zettelkästen](http://luhmann.surge.sh/communicating-with-slip-boxes) (Communicating with Slip Boxes) as well as in Sonkhe Ahren's book, [How To Take Smart Notes](https://www.sloww.co/how-to-take-smart-notes/). A fundamental component of the method is taking fleeting notes--the notes we make as we go through our day, listen to a lecture, read a paper-- into **permanent notes**. 

  A permanent note is:   
--> A single idea that is fully explained, in your own words, using complete sentences.   
--> That includes full citation information

There are a few reasons for creating permanent notes:

1. **Longevity of the note** Creating permanent notes allows the idea we have to not dissapear. While a quick note we jot down will make sense to us for a certain time interval, after a few years, notes that are jotted down in the moment lose their meaning. 
We might remember the keyword, but lose the context or clarity of what exactly a note meant. 

2. **Forces a check for comprehension** Often when we hear or read something, we believe we understand it. It is often not until we go to write it down or carefully explain it to someone else that we realize that there are holes in our understanding, or worse, that the idea doesn't make sense at all. 
By forcing the note taker to write out the idea in full, it provides the note taker a chance to guage how well the information is understood as well as providing an opportunity to return to the source material while it is still close by. 

3. **Ability to then sequence the notes.** Once the note/idea is translated into a permanent note or card, we now heve the incredible ability to connect that note/idea to other notes/ideas.

<details> 
 <summary> 2. What are reading notes? </summary>
 
 The way I usually take reading notes is that I make a quasai table of contents. For example, see notes for Safiya Noble.
 ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34726888/166835788-3722c62b-40e2-42c8-a177-d8ac4a6652a5.png)

 This method of notetaking generally is a good way for me to jog my memory of what the article was about, and is fairly easy to make. While it is more difficult to do if I consume books orally, creating a rough map of the argument is still possible. The hardest part frequently is making the citation. The idea is to have the citation made at the beginning of the week so that it encourages me to add reading notes.

 <summary> 3. What is obsidian </summary>
 
  I have found a tool called obsidian that lets me visualize my "permanent notes" which are currently stored as markdown files in github. I want to play around more with this software and figure out how I can use it to make connections between ideas.

<summary> 5. Pleasure Mapping </summary>
  
 ## Pleasure Mapping Group Exercise: Beta Test
The following is a description of an exercise I would like to run with my friends in a casual setting as a way to expand my conception of what spatial pleasure is. 
 
**Materials:**  
2-3 pieces of paper, a writing instrument, a sharpie/thick marker  

The goal of pleasure mapping is to explore  
--what in our environment gives us pleasure  
--what actions bring us pleasure   
--where are places that give us pleasure   
--what are the conditions necessary for pleasure  

### Before We Begin
I’m using this exercise as a way to inform my own understanding of places and pleasure in the process to write a thesis. If you would like to share anything you make in this mapping exercise with me, I would be grateful. However, you do not need to. I will also have some sharpies that you can use to redact anything you write if you would like to share some, but not all of what comes up

### Step One: Warm Up (5 minutes): 
With whoever is sitting next to you.   
Take a minute to think of a place that brings you pleasure.  
Share it with your partner/group and discuss what about that place brings you pleasure.  
_Option to share with full group depending on time_


### Step Two (5 minutes): 
Pick a city, neighborhood or area that you know well.  
On a piece of paper list places that you find pleasurable or places where you have experienced pleasure in that place.   

 
### Step Three (5 minutes):
Choose 2-3 places from the above list.   
If you have chosen two places, take one of the pieces of paper and fold it length-wise (hot-dog style). If you chose 3 places, fold the paper in thirds lengthwise. At the top of the columns you have created, write your chosen place.  Underneath list out as many attributes/qualities/descriptions of each place as you can think of. 

### Step Four: 
Is there anything that these places have in common with each other? If so, flip over the piece of paper and write anything they have in common down.   

### Step Five:
From here, I would want to break into group discussion. But before we dig in, I want everyone to pull up the second page. This page is for a free-form pleasure map. The idea here is a place for your mind to go wild.  I want you to fill this page with as many pleasurable things, places, amenities, activities, anything that you can think of. These can be real, imagined, or historic. I will give everyone two minutes to start their list now, but feel free to add to this list as the discussion unfolds.  

### Step Six: 
Redact.  
There is of course no requirement that you share either of your pages with me, but If you want to choose, I would love to have these papers (or pictures of them). You do not need to share anything at all. But If you do want to share, but you would like to redact anything before you share it, I have some markers that you can use.

*"Dont write the only thesis you can write. Write the thesis that only you can write. --Umberto Echo*  
 
### Production Culture + What can be gained from writing a thesis  
About four weeks ago around fifteen MUPs sat on the floor of 7 Sumner. The group was coming together after having broken off into small discussion groups as part of a student-led design charette to discuss frustrations with MUP Core Studio. After a representative from each group had presented takeaways from their presvious disucssions, someone offered a topic for discussion that had come through the critiques. *Production Culture*. The idea was that what we were contending with is a culture at the GSD (and in society generally) that has chosen to prioritize deliverables over learning. Instead of the core of our education being in service to our desired learning outcomes, we felt that our learning was being treated as a secondary objective in the process to create tangible deliverables. 

This idea of Production Culture has stuck with me over the last few weeks. In this assignment, I have been trying to think about how production culture applies to the MUP thesis process that I am about to begin. The more I thought about these two ideas together, the more it seemed that the masters thesis itself is a relic of productivity culture. The research process is designed around producing a deliverable object that meets specific length requirements and industry standards in the time alloted. In the abstract world where everything goes smoothly, hitting these requirements seems A-ok. But what happens when there are bumps in the road? Periods where time and energy is crucnhed and not sufficient? For me a tell-tale sign of productivity culture is that when sacrifices are made, what is eligbile to be cut is not the deliverable (ex the number of pages the thesis is) but the quality of the learning and thinking that has gone into it (ex just stay up late and fill some pages as quickly as possible). 
  
My pitch is that I am using this assignment to design the (infra)structure of a research process that treats the _deliverable/written thesis_ as a secondary outcome to learning. A process that prioritizes internal success ahead of external success *(see below)*  and that attemots to avoids certain pitfals *(see below)*. I do not think there is anything inherently wrong with deliverables. I think the ability to communicate effectively is vitally important. What this instead is attempting to do is to develop a process that will let me find what I want to say first, and then, and only then, communicate. 
  
#### Ways that a masters thesis can be considered a success  
####  External (Production Culture)
     1. It wins academic awards
     2. It is published in a journal 
     3. It is cited by other academics
     4. It helps the writer get into a phD program (or other job)
 #### Internal (What Im Aiming For)
     5. The writer spent a lot of time thinking about exactly what they want to think about
     6. The writer learns something they care about while writing it

#### Pitfalls To Avoid

      1. A process where you write your argument, then search for materials that support your argument
      2. A process where you get stuck writing about something that doesn't interest you. 
      3. A process that when time gets crunched, what is sacrificed is the substance while the "making it look neat/tidy" is treated as the non-negotiable neccesity

  # Pleasure Planning: 
### What American cities could learn from sex-positive education. 

It is almost easier to name what you cannot do in public spaces in the United States than it is to name what you can do. You cannot drink, you cannot play loud music, you cannot sell food, you cannot take recreational drugs, you cannot skateboard, you cannot sell wares, you cannot play with your dog off-leash, you cannot pitch a tent, you cannot nap, you cannot hang a hammock. What can you do? You can play oversized chess.

In her opening remarks decrying the state of planning in the Death and Life of Great American Cities, Jane Jacobs writes about contemporary projects that planners have made describing them as “marvels of dullness and regimentation, sealed against any buoyancy or vitality of city life…civic centers that are avoided by everyone, but bums, who have fewer choices of loitering places than others (62, Jacobs)”  This critique builds to her larger point that there is a tremendous folly in the way that planners are approaching their work, instead of learning from places where cities are vibrant and thriving such as The South End in Boston or Morningside Heights in NYC, they are relying on expertise. 

The field of Urban Planning has changed quite a bit since Jacobs wrote Great American Cities. Top-down planning of Robert Moses, urban renewal, and highway expansion have shifted towards “communicative planning” approaches that seek to involve community input. But even while these changes (that presumably, Jacobs would have supported) have shifted, critiques of planners creating sterile, lifeless environments remain. I argue that one reason we continue this creation of lackluster space is that we have not sufficiently taken up Jacob’s challenge to learn from cites as “laboratories of trial and error” where  “failure and success in city building and city design(63, Jacobs)”  is made apparent. Instead, we rely on digital renderings and “theories about cities (Jacobs, 66).”

I believe one of the “theories about cities” that damages our ability to create thriving public spaces is the assumption that activities with the potential to bother others are nuisances, that they are not critical, and that public space is improved when they are banned. This manner of handling potential harm by prohibiting it is essentially the civic equivalent of an abstinence-only sex education curriculum. We take a pleasurable activity that has inherent risks, but instead of attempting to manage the risks, we attempt to prevent the behavior entirely. Like abstinence, this method is deeply flawed. First, people are probably going to do the pleasurable thing anyway, and if they do, they will be approaching it already in the mindset of a “transgressor.” And secondly, pleasure is critically important to thriving.

As far as form goes, Redwood City Plaza (Redwood City, CA) and Parque México (Mexico City) are remarkably similar places. Redwood City Plaza was recently upgraded as part of a municipal planning project in the last decade (CDP, 2014) and Parque Mexico was renovated in 2008 (GCDMX, 2015). Both have a grand, sprawling paved area with water features, well-maintained planters, and plenty of places to sit. Both are near high-density, mixed-income residential neighborhoods. However, one is an uncomfortable wasteland and one is a beloved cultural hub. In Parque México, there are skateboarders grinding on railings, numerous vendors hawking food, dancers moving to loud music, men sitting on ledges drinking, dogs off leashes, kids kicking soccer balls, and teenagers smoking. In Redwood City, there is a singular office worker squinting at a laptop.
 I am not trying to argue that what makes Parque Mexico a successful public space is exclusively its permissiveness to behaviors that are traditionally prohibited in the US. But I do want to point out that many of the things that are bringing people pleasure in Parque Mexico  are things that are prohibited in American Parks. Looking at diverse groups of folks enjoying the park at golden hour, it is hard to justify any of those activities as anti-social or deviant. This then poses the question, where do our beliefs about what behaviors are acceptable come from? What is shaping our understanding of how a plaza should be used? Do these assumptions and attitudes, like assumptions about sex and sexuality, come from experience, or from what was modeled/taught to us?

 # Necesary Conditions for Pleasure: 
## Could Woonerfs be Reparative?

Just a little over a year ago Daunte Wright, a 20-year-old driving down a street in Minneapolis was pulled over by the police for a routine traffic stop. If you were around last year, you know the rest. 


For many of us, the last few years have provided more than enough evidence that the police need to be abolished, or at the very least, defunded. But for many, the resistance to heed calls for abolishing prisons or defunding the police stems not from a disagreement about the role prisons or police place in oppressing black and brown communities, but an inability to fathom what a world without them could look like. One way perhaps that we can tap into this imagination is to think about places and spaces in our society where we already don’t believe that we need policing. For example, imagine a very happy, hyper, young girl running to her younger brother. First imagine her along the edge of a swimming pool, then imagine her running through a wide-open field. In the first example, we can easily imagine the need of a lifeguard telling her to slow-down. However, in the second case, there is no need for her behavior to be controlled. The difference between these two situations is one of terrain. One terrain is treacherous and to be safe, it needs rules, and if it needs rules, it needs rule-enforcers. The other terrain is safe, it does not need rules, and so it does not need rule enforcers. 


In the article Reparative Planning in Action: The Case of Alliance for Community Transit- Los Angeles Song et al describe how the work of the transit advocacy group ACT-LA attempts to “shift the  narrative around transit safety beyond policing” (Song et al, 11).  Part of this work involved the group working with Angelenos to develop a “web of unsafety” that creates an understanding of what makes people feel unsafe—broken elevators, poor lighting, bad smells, long wait times, etc.  (Song, 2022). The argument underlying this work is that deep investment in public transit can create an environment that is safe, not because it is policed, but because it is no longer neglected. And by creating an environment that is “safe,” the need for law-enforcement is hobbled. 

The idea that ACT-LA uses of shifting the safety narrative can also apply to other forms of transit. Imagine a typical residential American street with two-lanes of traffic, broken sidewalks, and a playground. This terrain requires ‘policing’ because it is inherently treacherous. The laws of how fast a car can go is set not by the terrain, but by the imposition of a speed limit, signals such as stop signs and traffic lights, complex licensing and permitting of who is allowed to drive, and safety standards for the vehicles themselves. All entities that, to be effective, likely need to be externally enforced. So what would it mean to think about road safety beyond policing? It could mean redesigning the street in such a way  that the speed and manner by which a car navigates is not set by laws, but instead by the physical terrain.

  Take for example Woonerfs, the Dutch Street Typology that creates “shared streets’ by eliminating use-distinctions and introducing non-linear paths. These typologies, when implemented correctly, tend to force cars into significantly slower (and thus safer) speeds. Importantly, they also go beyond “traffic calming” measures like speed bumps that only seek to control behavior, as they simultaneously improve the experience of walking, biking and other modes of movement that have been made unpleasant and unsafe by our former city planners  in order to facilitate automotive traffic.


In 2016, while the focus of police violence was still two states away in Ferguson, Missouri, city officials in Minneapolis unveiled the city’s first “Woonerf” at Mill City Corner.  The project was implemented by the developers of Mill City Quarter Apartments and altered a 500 ft road between two much larger streets. <details> <summary> img 3 </summary>

  </details>I mention this somewhat paltry example of civic improvement to emphasize that I do not believe that ad-hoc woonerf projects will save us. Nor am I trying to say that the only way to end law-enforcement is to remove laws. Instead, what I am trying to argue is that the project to defund the police and abolish prisons is a project of coalition building and advocacy, but it is also a project  of observation and imagination.  In the epilogue to his article What Do We Mean When We Say, “Structural Racism?” Walter Johnson ends his piece with a critique of the response Emerson Electric, a manufacturing company in Ferguson, Missouri had to the Michael Brown protests. In response to the events of the summer surfacing the militarization, state-sponsored segregation and terror facing the community of Ferguson, Emerson Electric launched a run-of-the mill “talent identification” based scholarship that funded  the education of a few youths in the neighborhood. Johnson goes on to write, “The uprising in Ferguson, the outrage and direct action of people in the streets, has provided us with the opportunity to see our times anew. It is up to us to have the presence of mind to seize the moment.”  Emerson Electric by simply giving money to what businesses like Emerson Electric have always given money to was not seizing the moment. Municipal officials by funding the departments that municipal officials have always funded will not be seizing the moment. We need new responses.

 # Pleasure and Anti-Growth
  
  In a talk this past week describing the explosion of Condominiums and HOAs in the past 50 years, researcher/writer Evan McKenzie brought up the point that there is a pervasive myth that supply is just passively responding to what demand is. When in fact, supply is often aggressively promoting and creating conditions that induce demand. Abby's writing on REA pushing for growth is in essence a perfect example of this.
I think something that this myth of passive supply does is weaken the awareness of satiation. Growth in the modern capitalist era is not simply an increase of people who want goods/services, but in increase in how much an individual wants. This expansion of how much the individual wants tends to be treated as an unlimited capacity that is only limited by their means. However, where does this notion of unlimited capacity come from? We do not want to eat an unlimited amount, at some point we are full. We do not want to sleep an unlimited amount, at some point we want to get up. We do not want to have unlimited sex, at some point we are satiated. I think a way to think about this unlimited consumption is about ways that our satisfaction or satiation can be hidden or denied, and this is where Supply comes in. Advertisements are launched that tell us that the way that we are currently are is deficient, ugly, unhappy, backwards. They create in other words, an idea that we are Unsatisfied that seeks to overshadow any intrinsic conceptions of satiation. Taken to the extreme, I think that there is an argument to be made that while the general perception is that supply is passively responding to demand, a more realistic framing is that demand is largely just passively responding to supply (and the conditions that supply has created).
I was especially interested in the quote about "weakening dreams" and I wonder is there  a connection between growth, denial of satisfaction, and weakened dreams?
Below, an unsupported manifesto:
  
```
 Pleasure = Satisfaction
Satisfaction = Satiated
Satiated = Enough
Enough = Anti-Growth
Pleasure = Anti-Growth
  
  
denied pleasure = dissatisfaction
dissatisfaction = yearning
yearning = wanting more
wanting more = growth
denied pleasure = growth  
```
