## The thesis process I Want

### "Dont write the only thesis you can write. Write the thesis that only *you* can write. --Umberto Echo

### Pleasure Mapping

### Production Culture
Two weeks ago around fifteen MUPs sat on the floor of 7 Sumner. The group was coming together after having broken off into small discussion groups as part of a student-led design charette to discuss frustrations with MUP Core Studio. After a representative from each group had presented takeaways from their presvious disucssions, someone offered a topic for discussion that had come through the critiques. *Production Culture*. The idea was that what we were contending with is a culture at the GSD (and in society generally) that has chosen to prioritize deliverables over learning. Instead of the core of our education being in service to our desired learning outcomes, we felt that our learning was being treated as a secondary objective in the process to create tangible deliverables. 

This idea of Production Culture has stuck with me over the last few weeks. In this assignment, I want to think about how Production Culture applies to the MUP thesis process I am about to begin. 


### Objectives
Ways that a masters thesis can be considered a success  

     1. It wins academic awards
     2. It is published in a journal 
     3. It is cited by other academics
     4. It helps the writer get into a phD program (or other job)
     5. The writer spent a lot of time thinking about exactly what they want to think about


### Pitfalls

     Time-Crunch
     
      1. A process where you write your argument, then search for materials that support your time

I argue that the thesis itself is a relic of productivity culture. Research must be built around a deliverable object. 

I pose for this class. A class on experimental infrastructure a alternative to a literature review. 
Instead of identifying the sources I want to read to 

My belief is that if I identify who I want my teachers to be, the arguments and connections will emerge from there. 

Radical Situatedness: 
What do I want my education to be. 


The way that I want to frame this literature analysis is not

Leaky Infrastructure: Nikhil Anand


Critique is not: 
Emphasis on Design

Problem is that when time is crunched, what is sacrificed is not specifications of the deliverable, but the intentionality and thought 

My contention is this:
