### Post WWII, Housing Act of 1949
Sets goal for every family having a home. Embraces the public-private model (this is in large part from a need to not seem socialist)

**Title 1** of this act authorized "Slum Clearance," It also introduced the idea of urban renewal, but did not use those terms, instead described bligheted land and slums. Established the **Land Write-down model** that gov would buy blighted land and then sell at below cost (or $1) to private actors. 

**Title 2** Mortgage loan insurance for **new** construction (leads to disinvestment in the cities, and building suburbia)

**Searchterms**: Affordable Housing, Housing Acts, Disinvestment
