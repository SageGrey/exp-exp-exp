# Zettlekasten Method

The Zettlekasten method is a method of thinking, writing and notetaking developed by the the prolific 20th-century German Sociologist Niklas Luhmann (1927-1988). 
Luhmann's sytem which employed the clever use of a "slip box" is documented in his own writing, "[Kommunikation mit ZettelkÃ¤sten](http://luhmann.surge.sh/communicating-with-slip-boxes) (Communicating with Slip Boxes) as well as in Sonkhe Ahren's book, [How To Take Smart Notes](https://www.sloww.co/how-to-take-smart-notes/)
