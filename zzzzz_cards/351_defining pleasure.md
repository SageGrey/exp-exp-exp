Obviously there is no single all-encompassing definition for pleasure. The words in english we use to describe pleasure--Joy, Comfort, Satisfaction--are all words that claim an enormous share of disparate human sensations. What one person finds pleasurable is often pleasurable to many others, but not to all. When I use pleasure I mean to describe a spectrum of enjoyable human sensations. In this thesis instead of using a limiting definition of pleasure, I wish to instead use an abundant definition. As much as possible, I will only make claims that certain things ARE pleasure or pleasurable. I will try to avoid any language that makes statements about what is NOT pleasure or pleasurable. -
