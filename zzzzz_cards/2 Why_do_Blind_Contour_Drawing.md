# Why do Blind Contour Drawing

The point of the blind contour drawing is to move the pen on the page according to how the eye is moving along the edge of the object. Linking these two actions together (while depriving the drawer of all other visual feedback cues) snaps the drawer out of the habit of symbolically drawing an item as it "should be" and instead coaxes them into drawing the item as it actually is or appears to be.
