It's hard to know much about George Reid. We know that he was a fire fighter in Chicago. We know that he was a member of Engine 21. We assume that he was Black.

What we do know is a story from 1878. Supposedly one day George Reid and the white station captain, David Kenyon were stacking hay on the third floor of the fire station. The alarm went off and George, instead of taking the stairs, grabbed a long wooden pole used for transporting hay, planted it out the window, and slid down. With this swift movemet, Reid beat all the other fire fighters out the door. A few weeks later, David Kenyon, the station captain, had suceeded in getting permission to cut a hole in the floor and install a pole directly in the station. 

Engine 21 had quite a reputation. In 1872 it was the first station in Chicago to integrate to great horror (of white Chicagoans) and great celebration (to everyone else). The station had a reputation for being the fastest responders in the city. The firemans pole was seen as an explanation why. By the end of 1878 there are reports of other departments installing, "sliding poles." In 1880, Boston Fire Departments made the first pole out of Brass (there are some truly horrific accounts of splinters prior to metal poles). 

Since their conception firemans poles have been associated with injuries. In fact, in a notoriously dangerous profession, firemans poles are a leading cause of injury ((Newcomb, 2010).
