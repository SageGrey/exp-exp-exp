# How Loud is a Car

When BIKELIFE kids are accused for being too loud. They should be compared to how loud a car is. That decible should be the baseline for what the kids are allowed without complaint. A normal range for portable bluetooth speakers is 60-110 dcb at top volume [^1]. A car horn is 110 decibles, a standard decible for traffic is around 70-82 decibles[^2].
