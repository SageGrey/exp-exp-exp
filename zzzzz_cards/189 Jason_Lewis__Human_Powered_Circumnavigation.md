# Jason Lewis: Human Powered Circumnavigation

In 1994-2007 Jason Lewis completed a human powered circumnavigation of the planet which included mountain biking across europe, peddaling a boat named Mokska across the atlantic, inline skating across north america. He was struck by a drunk driver and broke both legs in pueblo colorado and was stopped at the border of sudan.

Sidenote: Reading the webcomic made about his travels he seems like a sexist asshole, but maybe it was done by someone else? Was in a cover band called Dougal Goes To Norway.
