# Two Tests for Exactions Legality

Two Tests for Legality of Exactions: 
    1. Essential Nexus (Comes from Nolan--expanding bungalow and path to beach)
    → There must be an essential nexus between impact of development and exaction and
    2. Rough Proportionality (Comes from Dolan – hardware store and bike path)
    → Must be a rough proportionality between harm of development and the exaction
