# Lakota Word for Remember Again

 Wokiksuye akhe (woh keegk soo yah ahkay): Remember Again

Tiokasin Ghosthorse told a story of lakota elders in the 70s/80s searching for an architect to build a college. They were going through a process, interviewing architects with "very impressive drawings" . Low-cost, materials were cheap. When asked where they would build the school (the lot was 1.3 million acres), they mostly responded with "well, wherever is convenient" by the road, by other buildings. One architect responded by saying that he would like to go to the land. He walked everyday for approximately two weeks, walking miles every day, until he found through intuition the spot he wanted to build the school. The lakota elders came out and agreed that this would be the person to build. The language generation would be taught in this place. The land remembers the experience we have given to the earth, the earth remebers how we have lived on the earth.   

There is in this case an acknowledge of intuitive knowledge and [z 92]chronological connectivity[/z]
