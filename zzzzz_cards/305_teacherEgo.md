#TeacherEgoAnger

Sometimes anger at a student who is failing to participate stems from a desire from that teacher to be validated. 


"A lot of my colleagues would look at this student and think she was lazy, disorganized, or apathetic. I know this because I’ve _heard_ how they talk about under-performing students. There’s often rage and resentment in their words and tone — _why won’t this student take my class seriously? Why won’t they make me feel important, interesting, smart?_
