Property owners pays for use of transportation as they would a utility. The fees are based on estimated travel given characteristics of the property. Usually are put as a line-item on another utility bill. 

The fee is not accruing to the owner of the building, but the occupant. 

There is precedent for small towns to get business owners together and decide who pays what share. 

One of the motivations for doing this was that there were a lot of parts of Provo, Utah that were tax-exempt (church properties, university owned by church, hospital) but were generating transit trips.
