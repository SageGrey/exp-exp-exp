# Seven Theories of Who Has Power in Cities

Notes from PPD, Jerold Kayden: 2-14-12 these notes are largely discussing _Alan Altshuler and David Luberoff, Mega-Projects: The Changing Politics of
Urban Public Investment (Washington, D.C.: Brookings Institution Press, 2003), pp. 45-75_

## Elite Reputational: 
This theory is based off of observations of Atlanta. The central tenant is that repuatation is essentially equal to power. So cultivating status is thus cultivating power. Who do you think is the most important person to consult is the top businessman or power broker. 

## Elite Structural Theory: 
This theory is a more Marxist approach that argues that structural features od society (capitalism) are the determinants of who has power. This is associated with the power coming from the institutions that have societal reproduction. 

## Pluralist
This theory is based on observations of New Haven. Is arguing against the elite reputational theories saying that there is actually a broad base of folks who influence the city that are widely disperesed. Argues that the power of elites is exaggerated. 

## Historical Institutional
Essentially is an argument for path dependency. What has happened heavily shapes what will. 

## Public Choice Theory
This theory essentially applies neo-classical economic theory to government actors. Argues that all actors in governemnt are ultimately making choices based on their self-interest, not neccesarily the public good. definitely this meshes well with Rick Ulibarri's beliefs about politics.  `How is James Buchanon is associated with this idea?`

## Growth Machine Theory
Given that many industries are benefited by growth (developers, lawyers, ad firms, architects, etc) there is a wide-based push from corporate forces to see things built. Example is why media companies love the construction of sports stadiums. 

## Regime Theory
This idea comes from Clarance Stone writing about Atlanta. It is similar to Growth Machine Theory, but it combines the interests of both private and public figures, what could be called "the elites."
