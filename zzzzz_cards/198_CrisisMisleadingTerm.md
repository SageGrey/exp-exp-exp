# "Crisis" as a misleading term

The use of the term "crisis" when applied to certain facets of society can be misleading. The idea of there being a "crisis" invokes the metaphor of a natural disaster where there has been a sudden disturbance which has thrown the sytstem into chaos. 
[However, this framing often misses that "the crisis" while severe is not a new phenomenon, but rather a feature of a given social system.](198a_HousingCrisisMadden.md).
