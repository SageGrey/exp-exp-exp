# Tips on Avoiding Distraction Caused by Emotional Discomfort


This was a podcast that I found extremely helpful. It had a tone that was somewhat irksome to me--mostly in that it did not question the value of producticty. But I found it to be strikingly insightful around the causes of distraction, namely emotional discomfort. I appreciate that it both gave me language for some of what It feels like to have work anxiety as well as some strategies that I'm excited about. 

Quick Pitch:
So overall its talking about how distraction doesn't neccesarily come as much from external stiumulus as much as it does from internal discomfort. They threw out this study (might be pop-science, but whatever) that 
 10% of distractions come from external triggers, leaving 90% coming from internal triggers, namely emotional discomfort. So in essence, dealing with distractions is actually an excercise in dealing with emotional discomfort.  

Below are some parts of it that really resonated with me::

**Surfing The Wave**

2. Strategy of "Surfing the Emotion." Instead of saying no to the ditraction, saying "not yet." The reccomendation is to set a timer for 10 minutes before you indulge in the distraction. During that time you can either do the task you were attempting, or sit with the negative emtion that is making it difficult. The theory is that the emotional discomfort that we feel is generally fleeting, and within that time span, you can ride the wave, feel it crest and fall. 

3. Discusses the psycological harm of day after day, year after year seeing yourself as unreliable because not everything on your to-do list was crossed off. Yet we know that the way mosts to-do lists function is that they are never fully completed--We add new things before we've caught up to what was already on there.   &#9;&#9;
