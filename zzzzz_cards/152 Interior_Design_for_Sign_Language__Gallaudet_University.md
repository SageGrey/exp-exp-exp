# Interior Design for Sign Language: Gallaudet University

A univeristy for the deaf, Gallaudet, included design choices such as:

-blue walls that would provide maximum contrast for signing (as compared to white or busy wallpaper)

-wood for benches (instead of concrete) that would allow vibrations to travel for communication

-low dividing walls and sight lines in the ccafeteria that would allow the divided space to be used as one large room for a speaker

-Using glass strategically so that people could communicate through walls (an opportunity not usually available).
