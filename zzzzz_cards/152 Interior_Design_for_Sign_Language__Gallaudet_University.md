# Interior Design for Sign Language: Gallaudet University

A univeristy for the deaf, Gallaudet, included design choices such as:

- blue walls that would provide maximum contrast for signing (as compared to white or busy wallpaper)

- wood for benches (instead of concrete) that would allow vibrations to travel for communication

- low dividing walls and sight lines in the cafeteria that would allow the divided space to be used as one large room for a speaker

- Using glass strategically so that people could communicate through walls (an opportunity not usually available).
