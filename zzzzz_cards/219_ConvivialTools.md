# Convivial Tools

In Ivan Illich's book 'Tools for Conviviality' (1973) he describes tools that have undermined peoples natural abilities and made them dependent on institutions and societal structures. This definition of tools is expasive, ranging from schools to industrial machinery. 

**Convivial tools** are the opposite. Instead â€œConvivial tools are those which give each person who uses them the greatest opportunity to enrich the environment with the fruits of his or her vision"[^1].
