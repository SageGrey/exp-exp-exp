# Dementia Care that values "Meaning of Life and Life's Pleasures" 

The Do Hogeweyk dementia care facility was renovated to de-institutionalize memory care. It has been accused of by critics and likened to the truman show, but it emphasizes design that does much of the work of broadcasting to residents where they are and that they are okay. The facilities include streets, stores, a restaurant and small living unit homes. The ability for residents to cook and have access to knives was determined as an **acceptable risk.**
