# Setup Notes

This program has to be run using Java. In order to do so I have turned on permissions for this file to be run. Otherwise, the computer will treat it as an archive of folders (or as a security threat becuase it's 3rd party software.)

I have set notes to be stored on your clip-it thumb drive in the folder Zettelkasten

I created a local backp at /Documents/ZettelkastenBackup 
It is set to automatically backup everytime you close the program. To restore a backup---or simply view your notes without the thumb drive on hand---go to File > Open and then select /Documents/ZettelkastenBackup/Zettelkasten.zkn3

I've also added the warm (solarized) color palette for the notes. 

Love,
Eden
