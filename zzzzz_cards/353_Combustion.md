*"But after industrialization began to alter the fundamentals of controlled burning, they increasingly sought to replace open flame with internal combustion and the fuels of living landscapes with those from fossil ones. In site after site, they replaced flame with sublimated surrogates. When the country established protected wildlands, it projected an industrial model into the wild. People quit lighting fires. They tracked down and quenched fires of any and all origins. And they established institutions to oversee the process." - Stephen Pyne, Between Two Fires: A History of Contemporary America

Abby Spinak is a historian and critical theorist studies the development of the electric grids across the United States. One of the trends that she points out in her work is the consequences of separating energy consumption from energy production. When fire is burned at a hearth, it makes soot at the hearth and smoke, the user understands the byproducts of that energy. When fossil fuel is burned at an electricity plant, this connection of consequences is severed. As a consequence, electricity was considered cleaner, not because it produces fewer biproducts, but because there is no smoke at the stove.
