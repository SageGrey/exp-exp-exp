The Just Transition framework (shown below) is described by Climate Justice Alliance as "a vision-led, unifying and place-based set of principles, processes and practices that build economic and political power to shift from an extractive economy to a regenerative economy." The framework is a synthesis of ideology that traces its roots to labor unions and environmental justice groups. 

The framework articulates the strategy needed to shift from an extractive economy to what is described as a living economy. The extractive economy, the current status quo, is a paradigm where resources are recklessly extracted, consumed and discarded, labor is exploited, and wealth and power is denied to all but a small minority. This extractive economy is supported by state violence and a worldview that embraces growth, consumption, and colonial extraction.  The living economy in contrast is one where resources are collected in a sustainable and regenerative fashion with non-extractive labor practices based on cooperation. Instead of enriching a small minority, the benefits of this economy are distributed. The system is not governed by imperial powers and violence but through a system where decision making is brought back to the smallest relevant scale and individuals are in control of decisions that impact their lives. This system is guided by a worldview that centers caring and treating life and environments as sacred. 

The overall strategy for this transition is to "starve and stop" the extractive economy and "feed and grow" the living economy. 

The following are six components denoted as part of this transition. 
* Reallocate economic resources and power away from international forces towards community control. 
* Create more in income distribution and workplaces (Democratize the Workplace )
* Push for more ecological restoration of degraded environments
* Work towards racial justice and social equity
* Create systems of production and consumption that keep the system local
* Support and restore cultural traditions and knowledge
