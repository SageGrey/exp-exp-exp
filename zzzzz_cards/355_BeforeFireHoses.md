Before fire hoses, there were bucket brigades. 
Long lines of community members passing buckets of water from a well. This all-hands on deck method, still considered today by efficiency and emergency experts as an excellent method of transporting materials,  would have required a wide subset of the community to come together in the event of a fire as active members of the response. 

The history of fire fighting seems to be a history of increasing reliance on technology over human labor. 
We live in a society where we rely on a specialized, highly specified force to put out fires. The responsibility to put out fire (beyond first-line defense) has been taken out of the hands of everyone else in the community. The role of the community members is usually now one of evacuation and assembly. 

The trick with this paradigm is that we are increasingly seeing fires that overwhelm what a specialized force can handle. Take for example the reports of the Paradise fire in 2018 which quickly overwhelmed the emergency plans and resources. The scale of fires, especially fires in high-risk areas, begin to bring into question the logic of firefighting (and fire rescue) being the exclusive responsibility of a small, specialized force.
