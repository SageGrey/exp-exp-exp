# Le Corbusier Disregard for Place


Le courbusier's plans are predicated on his belief that what currently exists cannot stand in the way. His belief that there must be no concession, either physical or social towards building the plan is articulated below:

Instead, his plans all require a city to be built on a cleared site.
