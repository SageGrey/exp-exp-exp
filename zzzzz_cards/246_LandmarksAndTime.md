# Landmarks and Start-Times 

In contrast to so many modern leisure activities, Night Skates tend to draw an unusually diverse crowd. In Boston's Tuesday Night Skate, in regular attendance are individuals from a wide array of occupations including (in alphabetical order): Airline Pilot, Architect, Au Pair, Astonomy Professor (Harvard), AV Engineer, Baker, Barber Biotech Entrepreneur, Boston University Econ Professor, Card Dealer at Encore Casino, Computer Scientist, Cyber Security Consultant, Economics Prof (BU), Grad Students, Upper Management at Duty Free, Real Estate Agent, and Venture Capitalist. 

Given that this is a crowd that doesn't tend to already know each other, for the group to form it is essential for there to be a set-start time and known landmark. In Boston this is Tuesday, 7:30pm at the Hatchshell. In NYC one group meets at 8pm Tuesday . In Mexico City, groups meet (essentially every day of the week) . Once a set-time and well-known location is set. The iformation can spread. While there are often facebook/whatsapp groups associated with the skates, many folks arrive through a tip-off from a stranger. Often folks will ask (and recieve the location/time information) as the group skates by them. As a general rule, each week there is always someone who has never skated with the group before.
