Things that have made me feel like I belonged in an academic institution: 

GSD
- Having a desk at Gund
- Having close friends + lots of acquaintances
- Getting good grades

STANFORD
- Being a part of groups that had power/agency

AA
- Locker


MONTE VISTA
- Having teachers who knew my family
- Living in the same neighborhood
