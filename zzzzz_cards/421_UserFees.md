The idea behind **User Fees** is that those who benefit from the transportation system should pay for it. Value Capture acknowledges that many more people benefit from a transportation system than just those who are moving

User fees are typically justified by a conception of **fairness** and a sense of **efficiency** (we should provide the amount of transportation that people are willing to pay for).
