# History of Acronyms

According to Gretchen McCulloch the 'true golden age of acronyms" doesn't really begin until the mid 20th century. The term "acronym" itself appears in 1940 and acronyms (especially ones that can be said as a word) take off with soldiers during WWII. After the war, acronyms continue flourishing espepcially for organizations and technology such as NASA, NAACP, UNESCO, MoA, NASDAQ, CD-ROM, DNA, UNICEF and people such as JFK, FDR, MLK.
