# Rabalder Park: Drainage Park

Skate park designed by (recently deceased) denmark architect Søren Nordal Enevoldsen with Nordarch architecture firm. The skatepark works as a drainage canal to protect a nearby housing project. The project was selected as a finalist for an Index Award. (Data fuzzy, somewhere around 2013) 

Enevoldsen told reporter Liz Stinson that the Skatepark is first and foremost a drainage system. The skapeark can hold up to 10 swimming pools of water. In his words this fact only adds to its authenticity. "Skateboarding has always been about adapting to surroundings."  (Enevlodsen)  "To a skater, a normal skatepark will always be a somewhat fake environment.” he says. “Like if you're a rock climber, it will always be more satisfying to climb in real mountain as opposed to a designed climbing wall.”

The skatepark is part of a larger design project called MUSICON which is transforming old factories around Rablader Park into new uses such as housing, office spaces, art studios and museums.
