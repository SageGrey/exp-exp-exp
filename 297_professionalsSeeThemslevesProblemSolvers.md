**problem solvers**

In three years of grad school, I have been taught to see the professions that deals with cities (urban planners, politicians, buerocrats) as problem solvers. Individuals that a role of understanding a problem, exploring solutions, and helping a community develop a solution. The extent to which this is a participatory endeavor ranges, however the central conceit of professionals as problem solver remains. 

This conceptualizar√≠an of urban professionals as problem solvers comes with two fundamentally tricky problems. 

1. It is unclear how frequently any problems facing cities has ever been "solved"
2. Identifying what a problem is heavily dependent on who is identifying the problem.
 
An alternate to planners perhaps could be stewards.
