## The Case for Increasing Rewards on Bluebike Angels Rewards Program
Sage Voorhees

 The Boston Bike Share program, Bluebikes, has been having a pretty good couple of years. The system launched in 2011 with 60 stations and 610 Bikes in Boston[^1]. In 2012 the system expanded to Somerville, Cambridge, Brookline[^2]. Everett joined in 2019 and in 2020 Arlington, Chelsea, Newton, Revere, and Watertown followed suit[^3]. Salem, Malden and Medford are the most recent recruits joining since the pandemic[^4]. Currently, across the Greater Boston region, Bluebikes boasts more than 400 stations and 4000+ bikes[^5]. In May, during the orange line shutdown, Bluebike broke single day ridership records 10 times and set a new annual ridership record, in May[^6]. 

 Yet despite the success of Bluebikes in terms of growth and ridership, the experience of using a Bluebike is often a frustrating one. Issues of proper bike balancing--stations having either too not enough bikes for demand, or not enough stations for returning bikes-- remains a persistent feature of the system, severely undercutting its reliability. According to survey results from a 2020 paper, trouble with renting/returning was found as a leading barrier for those using the Bluebike system[^7].

**1.2 The Bluebike Angel Program** 
To address stations with too many or too few bikes, Bluebikes employs a fleet of rebalancing vans and personnel and the Bluebike Angel program. 

The Bluebike Angels program is an incentive program to encourage riders to take bikes from crowded stations (with too many bikes) to emptier stations (with not enough bikes). Riders can earn points either for taking a bike away from a crowded station, taking a bike to an emptier station, or taking a bike from a crowded station to an emptier one. Riders can use the app to see points associated with each station. The points for each station are updated every 15 minutes.

**1.3 Current State of Rewards System**

A friend of mine who is a frequent Bluebike rider once described to me the Bluebike Angel points as "very fun, but largely meaningless." As the rewards stand right now, the satisfaction in earning points leads up to small rewards. The points are divided into two categories. Monthly points which reset each month, and lifetime points that accrue over time. Rewards for monthly passes include a 24hour guest pass, a week-long membership extensions, and eventually $1 for every 10 points.  Currently there is only one reward for Lifetime rewards, a Blue Bike Angels pin for 250 points. 

These points are similar to 

Monthly Rewards
|City|Public or Privately Owned|10 Points|20-80 Points| 80-200 Points| 200+ Points|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Boston Bluebike|Public|24-Hr "Adventure Pass" for a friend|1-Week Membership extension for every 20 points|$1 Gift Card for Every 10 Points|
|San Francisco Bay Wheels|||||

During a press release Abby Braughton, a senior operations manager at Lyft described the program, ""This is more about kind of getting people excited and more involved with balancing a healthy bike system, based on where you're going."

* Needed Paragraph 1
	* Inadequacy of current Bluebike Points
* Needed Paragraph 2
	* Inadequacy of how much rebalancing happens



One way of conceptualizing the Bluebike angel program is that the rewards are a way to incentivize people who are already making a bluebike trip to slightly ammend their behavior. For example, Instead of returning a bike to a station with too many bikes already, a point structure could incentivize someone to leave their bike at station that is less full, adding a few minutes of walking to the overall trip. Or they might walk a few extra minutes at the beginning of their trip to a station with more bikes. This pattern allows for some relief at individual stations, but since it is not changing the ultimate destination of that rider, it is limited in its contribution of the problem when a whole area faces a surplus or defecit of bikes. 

Another way to think about the rewards points is that if high enough, rewards could incentize someone to ride a bike with the explicit intention of balancing a bike. In the same way that folks with access to a car are incentivized to drive for a ride share company like Lyft or Uber, someone with the physical ability to ride a bike could choose to bike for Bluebike. Unlike the angel riders who are dropping off a bike, these bike angel rebalancers can take bikes away from high demand areas to areas with not enough bikes. 

What I will argue present in the rest of this paper is arguments for and thoughts on how the reward points could be raised high enough that it incentivizes a meaningful numbers of people to "ride for bluebike" as citizen bike rebalancers. 



Side Bar: 
My interest in this Bluebike Angels comes out of my personal experience.
Shortly after moving to Boston from out of state, I bought a bluebike membership and discovered the Bluebike Angel point systems. Very quickly, I found myself obsessed with getting as many points as I could. I principally saw it as a fun form of exercise. A few times a week I would jog or skateboard to a bluebike station, take the bike where it needed to go, and then jog or skateboard to the next station. I enjoyed it immensely for three reasons

1: It was a really fun way to get to know the city. The way that bike rebalancing in incentivized is that you choose the route based on where you can get points. It tends to be a series of short rides (less than 5 minutes), but these short rides tended to either lead me into neighborhoods that I had not had any other reason to go to. Or, they encouraged me to go down streets in the neighborhood I was living in, but would have had no other reason to go down. 

2: It felt good: One of the things I relished was the chance to workout while also doing what felt like a favor to strangers. More than once I returned a bike to an empty station RIGHT as a bluebike rider walked up to the station and was able to then immediately use the bike i had just delivered. 

3: The rewards were fun: While the rewards felt underwhelming, accruing points was very fun. 

### Arguments for Increased Compensation

**Reason 1: Improve Cycling Safety**

The City of Boston has been investing heavily in cycling infrastructure. This can be seen as a municipal effort to make biking in the city safer. 
Making changes such as protected bike lanes and signaling adjustments are important for bike safety, but they are not the only changes that can influence how safe it is to ride a bike. One thing that makes biking safer for everyone is simply having more bikers on the road. This strength in numbers phenomenon has been documented in a variety of cases, but one compelling study is the 2003 Jacobsen case. This case found that there is an inverse relationship between the likelihood of getting hit by a motorist and number of pedestrians and bicyclists.  An investment in Bike Angel programs would incentivize more people to rebalance bikes, putting more bikers on the road. If the research pointing to the strength in numbers is correct, this intervention would make biking safer as well as improve pedestrian safety and the safety of other non-motorized travelers. This also holds the promise of tapping into a virtuous cycle where as biking and non-motorized transit is perceived as safer, more people would chose it as a method of transit, making it in turn safer and more politically salient. More research would need to be done to argue this concretely, but investing in Blue Bike Angel rewards program could be a cost-effective way to improve bike safety as it could be done with minimal planning, disruption and capital expenditure compared to other projects such as street redevelopment. Large scale street redevelopment projects would likely also become easier and more politically viable as bike ridership increases. Investments in Bike Angel could also pull from sources, such as Vision Zero project, that focus on pedestrian safety. 


``` Jacbonsen Case 
article that concludes that, "  The likelihood that a given person walking or bicycling will be struck by a motorist varies inversely with the amount of walking or bicycling. This pattern is consistent across communities of varying size, from specific intersections to cities and countries, and across time periods." This study concludes with the researching that "[Given that] a motorist is less likely to collide with a person walking and bicycling if more people walk or bicycle. Policies that increase the numbers of people walking and bicycling appear to be an effective route to improving the safety of people walking and bicycling. 



**Jacobsen, 2003**

**Reason 2**: Keep Expenditure Local
Rebalancing bikes is not cheap. Currently the Bluebike system spends a hefty amount on obtaining and maintaining a fleet of rebalancing vans, paying for gas required for driving these vans, and paying for labor. Except for the money spent on labor, the money spent on rebalancing with vans is largely money that is leaving the Boston region. The vans are bought domestically Ford and General Motors, but is still money that is flowing to enormous companies with spotty tax and employment histories. According to reporting by Jamie L Reau at Detroit free press in 2019, "Ford Motor Co. has paid U.S. income tax only three of the last 10 years." General Motors has meanwhile shifted much of it's manufacturing to Mexico to skirt American labor and business practices. Even if turns out that investing heavily in Blue Bike Angels program was a more expensive way of achieving the current level of bike rebalancing, it would have the enormous benefit of keeping the expenditure local.

**Reason 3:** Extend Opportunities for Pleasure

**Pride In Ownership:** 
Bluebikes are a public amenity. The program receives funding from private sponsors and is operated by Lyft, but it is owned by the municipalities. In essence, it is owned by the people. Increasing compensation for the Bluebike Angel Program would create opportunities for the owners of Bluebikes (the people!) to engage in stewardship of this public asset and develop feelings of pride in ownership. 

Bluebike rebalancing encourages individuals to bike around neighborhoods that they have no pre-existing social or economic ties to. This encouragement of exploration combined with incentives, such as coupons to local businesses in each neighborhood, could lead to novel, positive experiences of civic exploration while also supporting local businesses across the city. 


**Reason 4:**  Cultivate Positive Relationships Between Transportation Department and Local Businesses

Local business owners frequently have combatitve relationships with efforts for the transportation departments plans to promote Bike Safety. For example, the recent plans to create protected bike lanes inspired a campaign led by porter square businesses that criticized the department for leaving them behind. Businesses often see plans to put in bike  lanes as making it harder to attract customers by removing parking, and taking away loading zones. Its an open question on how well businesses predict the impacts of reduced parking, one study found that business owners consistently overestimate how many of their customers drive. But what is clear is that often the first involvement a business has with the transpo department is an antagonistic one. 

The plan Im proposing has the potential to broker positive relationships between transportation department and local businesses. Bluebikes would in essence be offering low-cost, targeted advertising to local businesses. When bluebike riders go to a business and cash in their rewards, they would also be sending a message to store owners that customers are using bikes to reach them.

### What could increased compensation look like? 

For this Bluebike partnership I'm interested in exploring a partnership with public and private sector that inverts the relationship between the public being the consumer and the private sector being the producer. The proposal for how this would work is described in detail below, but the general gist is that the city would partner with local businesses in the way that a credit card rewards program or Groupon partners with private businesses. The city offers to help advertise local businesses through their platform in return for private businesses "matching" Bluebike point rewards. One advantage of this system would be to allow small businesses across sectors partner with the transportation department while helping the city "deliver value for public money ^[4]."

**The Idea**:  Bluebike increases the rewards for rebalancing a bike through the Bluebike Angels program. Instead of points that accrue to only very small advantages, Bluebikes sets the renumeration at something like 1$ for every 4 points.  Riders will have the option to "cash out" directly through Bluebikes or cash out through community businesses. 

The city will setup a portal that allows local businesses to opt-into becoming Bluebike Angel community partners. Once they have opted in and been approved by city staff, the business will be searchable through the "rewards" section of the Bluebikes app. A Bluebike angel rider can then choose to go to any of these businesses and "cash in" their points at this location through the app. After a purchase at a participating business, the city will compensate the local business according to the agreed upon rate.  Businesses will be allowed to change their rewards program on a predictable basis (monthly, quarterly etc.). 


**Rewards** 
Rewards: A business can choose to set any or all of the following rewards. 

**Base Conversion:** For every $1 of Bluebike Angel rewards, we will offer $__  in store credit. (Bluebikes will pay the business $1 for every 4 points cashed in. Minimum amplifier is set at $5 for every $1 of Bluebike awards). 

**10 Point Award:** If a Bluebike rider cashes in 10 points they will receive  BLANK SPACE  (For every 10 points, the city will pay the business $1.25. Value of 10 point reward MUST be a minimum of a 5 dollar Value ) 

**50 Point Award:** If a Bluebike rider cashes in 50 points they will receive BLANK SPACE _____ (For every 50 points, the city will pay the business $6.25. Value of 50 point reward MUST be a minimum of a 25 dollar Value )  

Example: 
	* JP Licks decides that the reward for **10 Bluebike Angel Points** is a single scoop ice cream cone and **50 Bluebike Angel Points** is a medium ice cream cake. 
	* Porter Square Nails decides that for **10 Bluebike Angel Points** they will upgrade a regular manicure to a gel manicure. And for **50 Bluebike Angel Points** they will give a free regular manicure. 
	* Tags Hardware decides that for every 1$ in Bluebike Angel points, they will match $5 in store credit. 




```
**For Non-Members:** Make rides that take a bike from a surplus station to a deficit station free. Fare would be refunded once the bike is returned. Fees for additional time and security deposit remain in place. 
```


##  Vignettes
In addition to an analytical argument, I want to include in the paper a series of vignettes that imagine what the system could look like with increased rewards. The following are an example, 

1. Adriana, Andrew and Claire are three freshman at MIT who all live in the same dorm.  After learning about how many Bluebike angel points you could earn on weekend nights, the trio decided to hang out together and see how many they could collect. Friday night, the trio met by the Bluebike station at Mass Ave and Amherst. After an hour of biking and walking, the trio ran into two Boston University students at a Boston Commons station who were also out enjoying the night and returning Bluebike. The two groups hit it off, and started traveling together. After a few hours of laughing and riding around their new city, the new group of five decided to go to Chilacates in Jamaica Plain and cash in some of their Bluebike points. For every 1$ in Bluebike rewards spent at their restaurant, Chilacates had agreed to match with 3$ of credit. Over their feast of tacos, the new friend group made plans to hang out when they reached 100 Bluebike Angel points and received their centennial reward--a choice between tickets to the Boston Symphony Orchestra or a Red Socks game.


2. Maria has lived in Roxbury since long before the Bluebike stations were installed throughout the neighborhood. Maria hardly noticed the bikes when they went in, but when her two teenage sons started returning bikes as part of the Bluebike Angels program, she started to think about them. Her eldest son started first, he and his friends would ride around until they had enough points to go see a movie (30 points to cash in for a ticket at Apple Cinema in Cambridge). Pretty soon her younger son was doing it too. At first she was nervous that biking in the city was dangerous, but when her boys convinced her to ride with them one Saturday, she saw just how many bikes were on the road. With that many bikes, she noticed that cars started driving more cautiously. Pretty soon her younger son had become a mini-expert on the system---anyone who came by the house would have no chance escaping a whole spiel about how the Bluebike system  worked, the discount programs they have, or how they bike re-balancing point structure. When a neighbor started talking about buying a car so that he could start driving for Uber, it was her younger son who talked to him. Her younger son brought over to his house a Boston Tribune article that calculated that when you compare all the hidden costs of driving for Uber such as vehicle deterioration and cleaning, the money you can make is similar to what you can make re-balancing bikes. But the thing that Maria likes the most about her sons re-balancing Bluebike is that they have become experts about the different college campuses across Boston. Because so many of the eligible points cluster near BU, MIT's, Harvard, and Northeastern's campus her boys have started spending a lot of time biking and jogging around those campuses. At home they quibble about who has the nicest one and which one has the most "free stuff" like museums and public performances. But in their jesting, she notices that they have increasingly started to say things like "when we are college students."


## Conclusion

With the amount of information presently available, its hard to tell if increasing compensation for the Bluebike Angel program would substantially decrease or increase profitability of the Bluebike system. 

But the profitability should not be the only factor that should be considered. The impact for cycling safety for all cyclists in the city, the reduction in carbon emissions, the potential for expansion of ridership to minority communities, and the opportunity for more  civic delight and pride are all **by themselves** things that cities should be happy to spend money on.

There are three key arguments that I wanted to make in the paper.
	ARGUMENT 1: Creating safe streets for cyclists and non-motorized vehicles is not just about bike lanes and cycling infrastructure, the more people riding, the safer everyone is. Investing heavily in the Bluebike Angel program and shifting/increasing bike re-balancing to blue bike angels could be a way to make cycling safer via a strength in numbers approach. 
	ARGUMENT 2: Current expenditure on gas and van maintenance is money that leaves the Boston area, spending more money on the Bluebike angel program (either giving it to angels directly or through partnerships with local businesses/institutions) would keep the money spent on bike re-balancing in the Boston-area economy. 
	ARGUMENT 3: Bluebikes are a public amenity, giving residents, especially teenagers, a playful and rewarding way to serve as stewards of this public resource could have numerous benefits. Investing in Bluebike Angels could have benefits such as boosting feelings of belonging and civic pride while also encouraging folks to discover and explore the city.
