##### Annotated Bibliography

The following is an annotated bibliography for a paper on blueBikes. I'm currently unsure which of the following questions I'm most interested in, so I am hoping that reading this literature will clarify interest. 

Potential Topics: 
1. What are ways that the blueBike system could be more accessible across a wide range of bodies? Could introducing tricycles or electric hand bikes (wheelchair compatible) help broaden access? 
2. Could regular voting or participatory decision-making strategies be used to increase feelings of agency for bikeshare riders? 
3. Could increasing the rewards BlueBike Angels Program help in rebalancing stations at a lower environmental and labor cost than the current van-based system?

> This literature review is slightly dated, but gives an overview of what formal research into bike share programs has been conducted internationally. In also provides context for the growth of bike share in the last 20 years. Some of the key studies it discusses look at the question who is using bike share and why. This literature review states that it is motivated by wanting there to be more Bike Share programs. The review is written by Elliot Fishman, a professor of Human Geography in the Netherlands. Given the background, am curious to see how the assumptions of a less car dependent culture factor in.

> This paper gives a more recent perspective into bikeshare research that has a more deliberate lens towards underrepresented communities. The research team is coming from a public health background. Seems like a fruitful paper for "citation surfing."

>  This is an academic research paper that looks at the first 18 months of a dockless bike program in Boston Suburbs. I will use this paper to see how the dockless bike program compares to Boston Bluebikes. Am still waiting on the request through Hollis, so don't know much more. 


**Accessibility**

Hendren, Sara. 2020. _What Can a Body Do?: How We Meet the Built World_. New York: Riverhead Books.

> A key takeaway of Hendren's argument is that we should embrace a community model of disability that sees the location of the disability not in the individual, but in how the individual meets the society. She argues that creating more inclusive spaces must be a creative endeavor. Part of why I want to include Hendren's work is that I find that it discusses inclusivity in a way that evades the sterilized and formal ways that ADA Compliance is often discussed. Hendren is a white, able-bodied academic. I want to include this work because I think it will help prime me to think about expanding who ride-share is accessible to as an opportunity/challenge, not only an issue/problem.  


**Participatory Decisions/Community Engagement** 
 Song, Lily. "Reparative Planning in Action: The Case of Alliance For Community Transportation" (Unpublished)

> Lily Song is a former professor at GSD who approached planning from a justice-oriented, progressive lens. This work discusses what makes a transit system feel "safe" that pulls upon knowledge that goes past traditional anti-crime initiatives. I'm interested at looking who was involved and engaged in the ACT-LA group. 

**Rebalancing** 

Kroes, James R., Andrew S. Manikas, and Thomas F. Gattiker. 2020. “Generating Efficient Rebalancing Routes for Bikeshare Programs Using a Genetic Algorithm.” _Journal of Cleaner Production_ 244: 118880-. [https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2019.118880](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2019.118880).
> This paper discusses the mathematical complexity of determining rebalancing, as well as the high costs of rebalancing (both emissions and cost). Will use this paper to generate an understanding of how rebalancing calculations are modeled as well as perceived problems in the field. This

> Not sure if this one will be useful for me, but will use it to fill in gaps that are not filled in by the Kroes study listed above.
