One of the key arguments in favor of cities investing in Bike Share programs is that they help cities hit greenhouse gas reduction roles. However, when calculating the greenhouse gas emission reductions, it is important to consider what greenhouse gas bike share programs themselves are creating (Kroes et all).[^1] Bike share programs require bike rebalancing, taking bikes away from full stations and bringing them to empty ones. Bike rebalancing is generally performed by vans that drive from station to station. Specific information about the carbon footprint of rebalancing vans is hard to come by, but while it likely does not outweigh the emission reduction benefits of increasing transit and cycling, it is still an important factor to consider (Kroes et al). If bikes are not adequately rebalanced, they will not be useful in reducing car trips, and in-turn, reducing greenhouse gas. But the more the system uses vans to rebalance, the more emissions the system will create.
