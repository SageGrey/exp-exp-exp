The Bluebike Angels program is an incentive program to encourage riders to take bikes from crowded stations (with too many bikes) to emptier stations (with not enough bikes). Riders can earn points either for taking a bike away from a crowded station, taking a bike to an emptier station, or taking a bike from a crowded station to an emptier one.

Riders can use the app to see points associated with each station. The points for each station are updated every 15 minutes.
