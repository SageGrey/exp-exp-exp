Transportation Economics**

I want to explore in this class how BlueBikes (and bike share programs in general) could better contend with high-volume events like concerts and festivals. I made the mistake once of trying to blueBike to the Boston Commons on the 4th of July only to realize that there were no available docks anywhere near the park. During the 30+ minute, disgruntled walk back to my destination it struck me that in mere hours would-be blueBike riders would be contending with the polar-opposite problem: no bikes remaining. 

Blue Bikes does currently have a strategy for dealing with high-traffic stations through their BlueBike Valet service; however, poking around online materials it seems that their solution "valet service" is predominantly deployed on a Monday-Friday basis for managing "rush hour" usage. It is not readily obvious how often it is deployed for "pleasurable" events where high-demand is also needed. 

That programs like Bluebike Valet remain rare for high-volume, non-work-related events appears to me to be the epitome of low-hanging fruit. If something like a "bike corral" can be made from a dozen-odd event fence panels, one to two employees, and a scanner--it seems reasonable to expect that managing high-demand through a bike corral could be a ubiquitous, easily contractable features of the BlueBike system.  

I'm looking forward to exploring the BlueBike transit system over the duration of the course both because of the ready availability of trip data from the city of Boston and also because BlueBikes are a main form of transportation for me. Another huge advantage for choosing BlueBikes as the subject for this class is that a close friend and former MUP (Miguel Perez Luna), is now working in the Cambridge Transportation Dept directly on the city's BlueBike program. This personal connection could give me access to interesting perspectives and information regarding the system. 

Classes that seem particularly relevant to this topic are: Supply, Demand and Consumer Surplus (9/23), Labor, Informality and the Gig Economy (9/30), and Public Private Partnerships (11/11). 

Two resources that I want to use are: a 2013 synthesis of Bike Share Literature and various datasets available through the City of Boston.
