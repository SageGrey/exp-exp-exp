**Summary**: Institutions can be put on a spectrum from **convivial to manipulative.** Convivial institutions such as groccery stores, telephone lines, or mail service are useful inherently whereas manipulative institutions produce the demand for their product/service as well as making their product or service. Highways for example are **false utilities** not only in their exclusivity (unable to be used by the whole public) but also because their existences creates the demand for more of themselves. 

    


## ZKN Notes 

**Intuitively Know School waste of time**
The negative feelings that many kids have about school and their belief that it is a waste of time are valid. Illich begins his book deschooling society with this idea, "Many students, especially those who are poor, intuitively know what the schools do for them" 
<deschooling, page 1>

**Schooled Imagination**
One of the results of going to school and being in a society that has a strong reliance on schools is that it incuclates a belief, what Ivan Illich called a "new logic" where we believe that the more interaction or involvement that we have with professionals and institutions, the better the ourcome. Illich writes, "Medical treatment is mistaken for healthcare, social work for the improvement of community life, police protection for safety, military poise for national security, the rat race for productive work." Illich describes this as a confusion of substance and process and a belief that escalation leads to success. <introduction>

**Cant carch up in school**
Schools are not actually spaces where equity can be achieved. Even if a rich and poor student started the exact same school at the exact same time, the opportunities and resources available to the richer student such as traveling, exposure to professionals through family members and sense of self are not equal. <6, Deschooling>
	Wealth Gap vs Income Gap


**Castro Deschooling**
Illich writes that Castro said that "by 1980 Cuba will be able to dissolve its univeristy since all life in Cuba will be an educational experience" (quote illich not castro) <7, Deschooling> 

**Make us think education is complex and costly** 

Because schools are perceived as the place where one can learn, they erode the belief that one can learn on ones own or without access to schools. Essentially undermining self-reliance and the belief that education is accesible. Illich writes, "The failures of school are taken by most people as a proof that education is a very costly, very complex, always arcane, and frequently almost impossible task." 
<8, Deschooling> 


**Organized Religion, Organized Schooling**
Compulsory Schooling is akin to Organized Religion. Spirituality or salvation can be obtained outside of the church in the way that "equal educational opportunity" can be attained outside of school, But currently education requirements are enforced by the state in much the same way that Kings enforced the beliefs of theologians through conquistadors amd the inquisition. It is enforced both by compulsory requirements as well as intense social and professional discrimination against those who did not attend <11, Illich>. 


**Illich quote on Performance Tests** 
"performance tests would remove the present absurd discrimination in favor of the persob who learns a given skill with the largest expenditure of public funds or--what is equally likely--has been able to obtain a diploma which has no relation to any useful skill or job." <11, deschooling>
