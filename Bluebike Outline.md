	* [[Concluding Argument]]
		* With the amount of information presently available, its hard to tell if increasing compensation for the Bluebike Angel program would substantially decrease or increase profitability of the Bluebike system. But the profitability of the system should not be the only factor that should be considered. The impact for cycling safety for all cyclists in the city, the reduction in carbon emissions, the potential for expansion of ridership to minority communities, and the opportunity for more civic delight and pride are all city priorities that cities are well-worth investing in.
