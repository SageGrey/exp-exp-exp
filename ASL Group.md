Hi friends! hope finals are wrapping up as smoothly as possible. This is the gathering of folks that expressed interest in learning a bit of ASL over break! 

Obviosuly we can do this however we want, but Ive been scheming about how I want to approach this and figured I would share in case anyone wants to join me. Would love to hear thoughts

My Plan:
Nowish - to Mid January
- ~10-15 minutes a day beginning to learn words in ASL using Anki Flashcards. I've had a lot of success using anki (spaced repetition method) before. I looked through a few decks and so far this is my favorite one. 
- Watch that days "ASL with Rochelle video" from her 31 day asl series. Videos are 5-10 minutes.  
- Practice fingerspelling 

January 9th-20th
* Schedule a few lessons with an online ASL tutor

January 16th-22nd
* Thia group meets in person once or twice?

Anki Deck

ASL with Rochelle. 
* This seems like a good channel to start getting my head wrapped around ASL mechanics [](https://youtu.be/Niyz8wHXZX4)
