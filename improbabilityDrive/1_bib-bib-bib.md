        The notion of anti-homeless policing is documented by Mark Engels in his 1845 work in his chapter "The Great Towns" from his 1845 work, The Conditions of the Working Class in England in 1844. 
        "If he can get no work he may steal, if he is not afraid of the police, or starve, in which case the police will take care that he does so in a quiet an inoffensive manner.'

           ###### Notes From Eve Balu's Class 1/27/22
           `**Argument synthesiss**
            Job of planner is to maintain the state. This means perpetuating the existing social order. 
            Primarily serve the interest of capital over labor. 
            Helping poor/disenfranchized is in direct contention w/ holding up state as is (Capital Interest).   
            This Contradiction results in planning needing to constantly re-adjust/reconceive of themselves in the field.
            In society there are occasionaly moments of "crisis of ideology" where tension is so high where planners intervene and create short-term reforms. 
            An example of this is the civil rights movememnt in the 1960s, but much of the progress of the reforms were wiped out in the 80s. 
            Instead of adhering to an ideology of harmony, planners should recognize that harmony legitimates the domination of capital interest over labor. 
            Planners should plan not cities, policy, etc, but the reconstruction of society itself. 
            Planners do have some agency, but reforms are ineffective, they need to work towards the reconfiguration of society.`
