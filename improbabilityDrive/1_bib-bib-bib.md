        **ZKN:** What would our lives be like if we took earthworms seriously, took the ground
under our feet rather than the skies above our heads, as the place to look as
well as, eventually, as the place to be? It is as though we have been pointed
in the wrong direction., Adam Phillips 

       ZKN: to invent the train is also to invent the plane crash Ltringer and Virilio, 2003, (pg 4). Connect to Crisis Card.

       ZKN: Parents have to become experts very quickly. 
       
       ZKN: Commercial buildings are often, in certain senses, in even worse
condition, in part because architects themselves rarely consider or take into
their designs the business of maintenance and repair: ‘they see the people
who do the maintaining as blue collar illiterates and the process of upkeep
as trivial, not a part of design concerns’ (Brand, 1994: 112). Thus, one:
. . . survey of fifty-eight new business buildings near London [found that] ‘a
staggering one-fifth of the sample said that the need to clean their windows
had not even been considered during the design and construction of the

building’. Also light fixtures in the grand lobbies were unreachable for lamp
replacement, and internal drains from the flat roofs had no access hatches for
inspection and cleaning. (1994: 112) (6)


6 Such associations
point to the way in which maintenance and repair is increasingly thought
of as a generic activity, the model for which can be spread across many
realms of everyday life.(16)

           ###### Notes From Eve Balu's Class 1/27/22
           `**Argument synthesiss**
            Job of planner is to maintain the state. This means perpetuating the existing social order. 
            Primarily serve the interest of capital over labor. 
            Helping poor/disenfranchized is in direct contention w/ holding up state as is (Capital Interest).   
            This Contradiction results in planning needing to constantly re-adjust/reconceive of themselves in the field.
            In society there are occasionaly moments of "crisis of ideology" where tension is so high where planners intervene and create short-term reforms. 
            An example of this is the civil rights movememnt in the 1960s, but much of the progress of the reforms were wiped out in the 80s. 
            Instead of adhering to an ideology of harmony, planners should recognize that harmony legitimates the domination of capital interest over labor. 
            Planners should plan not cities, policy, etc, but the reconstruction of society itself. 
            Planners do have some agency, but reforms are ineffective, they need to work towards the reconfiguration of society.`

         Discusssed the Importance of Andrew Jackson Downing who might have been considered the father of the parks movement if not for his untimely death in a boat accident at a young age. Downing was a staunch advocate for parks and advocat for parks, involved in the establishment of Mount Auburn Cemetery. 
         
         Building natural cemeteries was a turning point for park development as it made city leaders realize that families were flocking to them for recreation. 
         
         Seneca Village was cleared for the Creation of Central Park
         
         Neccesity leading to pleasure. Part of the impetus for Olmstead designing the emerald necklace in boston and his "system of parks" was that the muddy river was filling with excrement due to the development of the Back Bay. 
         
         In cities like Kansas City during the  late 19th/early 20th, park planning WAS city planning.

allow them to claim and access other public urban services and substances of citizenship—like housing, health, and education.  In short, relative to private systems, public systems are known systems that are more accommodating of vital forms of leakage that nourish those marginalized by states and markets in the city. Public infrastructures are more amenable to hidden, partly known, materialized arrangements through which millions of residents access water and live in the city.

              Reading the description of Jogeshwari (Chapter 2, pg 73) I was struck by the parallels between red lining and the difficulty of members of the neighborhood getting bank loans. The longer I think about it, the less it seems insightful or new, but thinking about the fight for civil rights in the united states as a fight for citizenship is a subtly different framing than the one I am accustomed to.

            I was struck by the sentence "By mobilizing their sympathies, and coaxing them with **small amounts of money**, these arrangements...made very exclusive rules and laws more accomodating and made life in the city possible." It made me think of the organizations (that I associate with effective altruism) that think about where could money be spent to maximize its impact. I feel that the ehtos of that work is perpendicular to what is happeneing here, but I think its an interesting similarity/observation that there are places where a little nudge is amplified. (ie compare these bribes to the scale of investments from groups like World Bank, USAID, etc.)

  Take-Aways:
  **Analysis of 40 Acres, pg 3**   
 American reparation planning is historically rooted in organizing and advocacy by formerly  enslaved people, their descendants, and accomplices (Aiyetoro and Davis 2009). While the 1861 Confiscation Act and Freedman’s Bureau Bills (1865-1866) are widely credited for  proposing allocations of forty-acre plots and fifty dollars to formerly enslaved families, such  federal measures were soundly reversed by congressional leaders who instead compensated  slave owners and loyal Southerners.
 
 **Goal of Reperatory Planning, pg 4**
Kelley  frames reparations “as a broad strategy to radically transform society—redistributing  wealth, creating a democratic and caring public culture, exposing the ways capitalism and  slavery produced massive inequality” (129).

**Abolistionist Planning Efforts, pg 4** 
If reparation is "abolition in action," as stated by Patrisse Cullors, cofounder of Black Lives  Matter— the decentralized political and grassroots movement most prominently leading the  contemporary struggle to abolish mass incarceration, capital punishment, and police  violence—it seems appropriate to consider reparative planning in light of abolitionist  planning debates.2 In 2017, a group of graduate students at UCLA co-facilitated a course,  "Abolitionist Planning in Today’s Political Conjuncture," and published an abolitionist  planning guide for urban planners. In response to the election of Trump, the group sought to  invoke abolition in their study and practice as a “framework for urban planning practitioners  to combat and reverse oppression of marginalized communities while also deferring to the  experiences and expertise of these communities.” The framework identifies potential  avenues to implement abolitionist planning such as community control, housing and urban  inclusivity, environmental racism and ecology, and safe streets. Subsequently, Deshonay  Dozier’s "A Response to Abolitionist Planning" (2018) raised the intractable question of  whether professional planning could actually contribute to abolition as an “institution of  harm complicit in the making of penal systems“ and as a central conduit of violence against  Indigenous, Black, Brown, Asian and poor people. Dozier’s piece conceptualizes abolition as  

**BLM Reperations Now Toolkit**
 BLM’s Reparations Now Toolkit further outlines five key components of reparations: (1) Official  acknowledgment and apology for harm, public education, or memorial about the harm; (2) Compensation to a  specific, defined group of individuals harmed by a violation, including descendants, as well as family and  community members of individuals directly targeted for harm who were adversely affected’; (3) Restitution  and Repatriation—Action to restore individuals harmed to the position they were in before the initial harm  occurred; (4) Cessation/Assurance of Non-Repetition—Action to stop the systems, institutions, and practices  causing the harm; and (5) Rehabilitation—Changes to laws, institutions, and systems aimed at ensuring that  harm will not happen again They additionally note: “reparations cannot be achieved simply through  ‘acknowledgment or an apology’ or ‘investment in underprivileged communities.”

**Shift Narrative Beyond Policing, pg 11**
ACT-LA seized this window of opportunity to shift the  narrative around transit safety beyond policing and escalate their advocacy to end Metro’s  multi-agency policing contract by 2022. As recalled by an ACT-LA organizer,

** Embodied Perspectives** A common feature of ACT-LA convenings is that the agenda includes a creative exercise that  invites participants to tap into their imagination and embodied perspectives in manifesting campaign goals. As characterized by an ACT-LA staff member, much of the work they do is  imagination work, “pushing imagination” and asking “what world do we want to live in” even  though “what could work for us doesn’t necessarily exist yet.“ For example, the public  webinar that initially framed the issue of public safety on metro began with a guided  meditation in which the facilitator asked participants to close their eyes and imagine how 

** conclusions, holistic safety 14 **
That ACT-LA's approach to reparative planning is relational and solidaristic—as opposed to  techno-managerial and professionalized—appears instructive for reparative planning  scholars and practitioners....Beyond simply critiquing how capitalist culture consumes our cities and  dehumanizes people, they are actively fighting to decommodify housing— through  inclusionary zoning and tenant protections, decommodify transit—via fare-free transit, and

demilitarize public space—by redirecting funding from multi-agency policing to investments  in care-centered spatial tactics, stewardship, programming, support services, public  education, and job creation that promote holistic safety.
