          TODO: add How Buildings Learn 1994 to reading list

        **ZKN:** What would our lives be like if we took earthworms seriously, took the ground
under our feet rather than the skies above our heads, as the place to look as
well as, eventually, as the place to be? It is as though we have been pointed
in the wrong direction., Adam Phillips 

       ZKN: to invent the train is also to invent the plane crash Ltringer and Virilio, 2003, (pg 4). Connect to Crisis Card. 
       
       ZKN: Maintenance as learning. Connect to Haussmans plan for paris. 
       
       ZKN: Parents have to become experts very quickly. 
       
       ZKN: Commercial buildings are often, in certain senses, in even worse
condition, in part because architects themselves rarely consider or take into
their designs the business of maintenance and repair: ‘they see the people
who do the maintaining as blue collar illiterates and the process of upkeep
as trivial, not a part of design concerns’ (Brand, 1994: 112). Thus, one:
. . . survey of fifty-eight new business buildings near London [found that] ‘a
staggering one-fifth of the sample said that the need to clean their windows
had not even been considered during the design and construction of the

building’. Also light fixtures in the grand lobbies were unreachable for lamp
replacement, and internal drains from the flat roofs had no access hatches for
inspection and cleaning. (1994: 112) (6)


6 Such associations
point to the way in which maintenance and repair is increasingly thought
of as a generic activity, the model for which can be spread across many
realms of everyday life.(16)

           ###### Notes From Eve Balu's Class 1/27/22
           `**Argument synthesiss**
            Job of planner is to maintain the state. This means perpetuating the existing social order. 
            Primarily serve the interest of capital over labor. 
            Helping poor/disenfranchized is in direct contention w/ holding up state as is (Capital Interest).   
            This Contradiction results in planning needing to constantly re-adjust/reconceive of themselves in the field.
            In society there are occasionaly moments of "crisis of ideology" where tension is so high where planners intervene and create short-term reforms. 
            An example of this is the civil rights movememnt in the 1960s, but much of the progress of the reforms were wiped out in the 80s. 
            Instead of adhering to an ideology of harmony, planners should recognize that harmony legitimates the domination of capital interest over labor. 
            Planners should plan not cities, policy, etc, but the reconstruction of society itself. 
            Planners do have some agency, but reforms are ineffective, they need to work towards the reconfiguration of society.`

         Described 2nd half of the 19th century as the *Furnace Stage*
         
         Discusssed the Importance of Andrew Jackson Downing who might have been considered the father of the parks movement if not for his untimely death in a boat accident at a young age. Downing was a staunch advocate for parks and advocat for parks, involved in the establishment of Mount Auburn Cemetery. 
         
         Building natural cemeteries was a turning point for park development as it made city leaders realize that families were flocking to them for recreation. 
         
         Seneca Village was cleared for the Creation of Central Park
         
         Neccesity leading to pleasure. Part of the impetus for Olmstead designing the emerald necklace in boston and his "system of parks" was that the muddy river was filling with excrement due to the development of the Back Bay.
