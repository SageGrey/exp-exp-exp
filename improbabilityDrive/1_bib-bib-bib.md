          TODO: add How Buildings Learn 1994 to reading list

        **ZKN:** What would our lives be like if we took earthworms seriously, took the ground
under our feet rather than the skies above our heads, as the place to look as
well as, eventually, as the place to be? It is as though we have been pointed
in the wrong direction., Adam Phillips 

       ZKN: to invent the train is also to invent the plane crash Ltringer and Virilio, 2003, (pg 4). Connect to Crisis Card. 
       
       ZKN: Maintenance as learning. Connect to Haussmans plan for paris. 
       
       ZKN: Parents have to become experts very quickly. 
       
       ZKN: Commercial buildings are often, in certain senses, in even worse
condition, in part because architects themselves rarely consider or take into
their designs the business of maintenance and repair: ‘they see the people
who do the maintaining as blue collar illiterates and the process of upkeep
as trivial, not a part of design concerns’ (Brand, 1994: 112). Thus, one:
. . . survey of fifty-eight new business buildings near London [found that] ‘a
staggering one-fifth of the sample said that the need to clean their windows
had not even been considered during the design and construction of the

building’. Also light fixtures in the grand lobbies were unreachable for lamp
replacement, and internal drains from the flat roofs had no access hatches for
inspection and cleaning. (1994: 112) (6)


6 Such associations
point to the way in which maintenance and repair is increasingly thought
of as a generic activity, the model for which can be spread across many
realms of everyday life.(16)

           ###### Notes From Eve Balu's Class 1/27/22
           `**Argument synthesiss**
            Job of planner is to maintain the state. This means perpetuating the existing social order. 
            Primarily serve the interest of capital over labor. 
            Helping poor/disenfranchized is in direct contention w/ holding up state as is (Capital Interest).   
            This Contradiction results in planning needing to constantly re-adjust/reconceive of themselves in the field.
            In society there are occasionaly moments of "crisis of ideology" where tension is so high where planners intervene and create short-term reforms. 
            An example of this is the civil rights movememnt in the 1960s, but much of the progress of the reforms were wiped out in the 80s. 
            Instead of adhering to an ideology of harmony, planners should recognize that harmony legitimates the domination of capital interest over labor. 
            Planners should plan not cities, policy, etc, but the reconstruction of society itself. 
            Planners do have some agency, but reforms are ineffective, they need to work towards the reconfiguration of society.`

         Described 2nd half of the 19th century as the *Furnace Stage*
         
         Discusssed the Importance of Andrew Jackson Downing who might have been considered the father of the parks movement if not for his untimely death in a boat accident at a young age. Downing was a staunch advocate for parks and advocat for parks, involved in the establishment of Mount Auburn Cemetery. 
         
         Building natural cemeteries was a turning point for park development as it made city leaders realize that families were flocking to them for recreation. 
         
         Seneca Village was cleared for the Creation of Central Park
         
         Neccesity leading to pleasure. Part of the impetus for Olmstead designing the emerald necklace in boston and his "system of parks" was that the muddy river was filling with excrement due to the development of the Back Bay. 
         
         In cities like Kansas City during the  late 19th/early 20th, park planning WAS city planning. 
         
         Visit a park to become less cynical about the "socializing potential of social spaces."

        'In this book I argue that settlers demand public water systems not because public systems deliver reliable supplies to all. Settlers desire public systems because, relative to private infrastructures, these “bloated,” “inefficient” public systems are known systems that offer many more points of access (of-
ficials, politicians, social workers, and leaky pipes) through which settlers can be connected to the hydraulic city. Settlers also desire water through the
public system because its documents (printed on government stationary)
allow them to claim and access other public urban services and substances of citizenship—like housing, health, and education.  In short, relative to private systems, public systems are known systems that are more accommodating of vital forms of leakage that nourish those marginalized by states and markets in the city. Public infrastructures are more amenable to hidden, partly known, materialized arrangements through which millions of residents access water and live in the city.

It made me think of the organizations (that I associate with effective altruism) that think about where could money be spent to maximize its impact. I feel that the ehtos of that work is perpendicular to what is happeneing here, but I think its an interesting similarity/observation that there are places where a little nudge is amplified.

 **Repeal Day**
This month, 80 years later, some Americans celebrated the anniversary of the Repeal with old-timey cocktails, good craft beer or at least a festive hashtag (#RepealDay!). But there wasn't much drinking in the streets. Because America is in the grip of a new Prohibition: One that makes it illegal to drink alcohol in public.
 
 **Hundreds of Thousands**
 Hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of people are arrested or ticketed for drinking in public every year. Millions of others refrain from doing so because they have been conditioned to believe that public drinking is an act as obviously illegal as shoplifting or nude sunbathing in a city park -- even though it was perfectly legal nearly everywhere in the world as recently as 1975.
 
 
 **weaving the net**
 This Prohibition, unlike the last, isn't the result of a constitutional amendment. Nor did it emerge overnight. The net of laws that now bans public drinking across most of the country took state and city lawmakers 40 years to weave. Most of these laws attracted as little public notice upon their passage as any other state or municipal law, which has allowed this net to be lowered so slowly and quietly that many people don't realize that anything has changed.
 
 **common justification**
 nother difference between this Prohibition and the one that ended 80 years ago? Many of the people who are aware of this one actually like it. They say that the virtually nationwide ban on public drinking has "cleaned up the streets," reduced per capita alcohol consumption and even helped slash the incidence of serious crimes such as murder and arson.

They may have a point. But it's also likely that they underestimate the price we pay for the benefits of this Prohibition. Decades of evidence suggest that laws against public drinking are enforced unequally and capriciously, disproportionately hurting the most downtrodden members of society. More fundamentally, these laws allow the state to interfere with individual behavior to prevent an act that in itself harms no one.
 
 **stats**
 public drinking is now punishable by fine or jail time across the vast majority of the country. Seventeen states ban it completely. It's also illegal in 89 of the 100 most populous cities in the country, including the top 10. The map below illustrates the bewildering patchwork of public drinking laws currently in effect across the U.S.:


 ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34726888/165386096-ed4197ef-ccd6-4b44-b296-a2a59a8cd110.png)
 ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34726888/165386342-d91ab82a-449c-4b18-9588-56bd8f507e54.png)


 **range of fines**
 But this map actually masks the true extent of the confusion, because the various municipal and state statutes banning the behavior define the offense in myriad ways. They also stipulate a huge range of penalties for offenders, from a simple fine of $25, payable by mail (New York City), to a ticket of up to $1,000 or a jail sentence of up to 6 months (Hawaii and New Mexico).
 
 **20 cities where allowed** HuffPost's analysis could only positively identify 20 towns or cities of any size in which drinking is legal in some, if not all, public places. About half of these cities allow public drinking only in specially designated "Entertainment Districts" that have been established in the past few years in the hopes of attracting booze-loving tourists.)
 
 The cities that do allow drinking in public don't have as much in common as one might think. Cities as varied as New Orleans and Butte, Mont., Las Vegas and Savannah, Ga., allow residents and tourists alike to drink in the streets and parks.
 
 **never banned** 
 But to ask how these places were independently able to legalize public drinking is to fundamentally misunderstand the situation. Towns like New Orleans and Butte didn't have to take specific steps to allow public drinking -- they just never banned it.
 
 **public drunkeness, regulation of sale** 
 But until the middle of the 20th century, there were exactly two types of American alcohol law: regulations of its sale and bans on public drunkenness. Neither sought to control drinking directly.
 
**laws regulating social activities**
 The great legal minds of the 19th Century generally believed that laws should only regulate social activities, or conduct involving multiple parties. The philosopher John Stuart Mill, for example, argued, in his famous essay "On Liberty":

Whenever, in short, there is a definite damage, or a definite risk of damage, either to an individual or to the public, the case is taken out of the province of liberty, and placed in that of morality or law. 
 
But with regard to the merely contingent, or, as it may be called, constructive injury which a person causes to society, by conduct which neither violates any specific duty to the public, nor occasions perceptible hurt to any assignable individual except himself; the inconvenience is one which society can afford to bear, for the sake of the greater good of human freedom.
 
 
 **Victorian Social Mores*
 A combination of Victorian social mores and a scarcity of disposable drinking vessels kept most Americans from partaking in their legal right to drink in public too often. But public drinking was certainly a feature of everyday life. Miners and laborers on their lunch hour would pay women and children to bring them buckets of draught beer from local saloons for open-air consumption, a practice known as "rushing the growler."
 
 **land of steady habits**
 In one newspaper article in 1868, Mark Twain dismissed New England as "the land of steady habits" because he noted so few people drinking and smoking in the streets.
 
**The Volstead Act,** the sweeping 1919 federal law that enforced Prohibition, specifically banned the carrying of containers of alcohol in the street, among other things. The nominal justification for this measure was that carrying wine or bourbon down the street was assumed to be evidence of intent to sell. So the measure was still, at its heart, a regulation of sales. But it effectively confined drinking to speakeasies and private homes.
 
 **Pre-emptive,  Chicago Debut**
 But 20 years and seven days after the repeal of the 18th Amendment, Chicago Alderman Harry L. Sain, who represented the city's 27th Ward, approached his fellow aldermen with a problem. He said he was hearing more and more reports of "bottle gangs" -- groups of indigent men who would stand on sidewalks sharing bottles of liquor -- plaguing the Skid Row of his district, and littering the streets with empty wine bottles and beer cans. Chicago police officers could arrest rowdy individuals using the city's broadly defined ban on "disorderly conduct," but Sain wanted them to be able to break up the bottle gangs before they got rowdy.
 His solution? A law that would prohibit "drinking in the public way," namely city streets, parks, vacant lots and any other place open to public view. Violators were subject to a $200 fine, the equivalent of about $1,750 in today's money. On Dec. 12, 1953, the law passed handily. One of Sain's fellow aldermen, Mathias Bowler, told the Chicago Tribune the new law was "good news for [his] ward too," noting that he'd heard that "five fellows die[d] there drinking out of bottles on the street."


 Newport, R.I., was where they hit the big time.
Over July 4th weekend 1960, the traditional summer resort for the East Coast elite was the scene of a notorious drunken riot. The town was hosting one of the most important jazz festivals in the country for its sixth summer. But after a popular 1959 documentary about the festival raised the event's profile, 12,000 teens showed up hoping to see Louis Armstrong, Dizzy Gillespie and Dinah Washington perform, only to find it sold out. While loitering outside the concert, they started drinking. Then they got angry. About 2,000 of them charged the gates of the festival. Newport police tried to hold them back, but the crowd started throwing beer cans and wine bottles. The police called in the National Guard, which dispersed the crowd with tear gas. It was a disaster.
 About 2,000 of them charged the gates of the festival. Newport police tried to hold them back, but the crowd started throwing beer cans and wine bottles. The police called in the National Guard, which dispersed the crowd with tear gas. It was a disaster.
 The following year, Newport regrouped, revising its criminal code to better accommodate the festival. One of the key changes, as the Boston Globe put it, was that a "special ordinance bans drinking in public." The reforms worked, and subsequent festivals went off without a hitch.
 
 **Rowdy Teens**
 The success of the Newport law inspired other towns across the country that were struggling to control large groups of rowdy, drunken teens -- in particular the Florida towns to which college students started flocking for Spring Break after the release of movies like "Gidget" and "Where The Boys Are." Fort Myers, Jacksonville, Miami, Daytona Beach and Hialeah all passed restrictions on public drinking between 1964 and 1970, years before most other towns in America did. 
 
 
 **Common Drunkards** In 1963, it was unlikely that you would have been arrested for drinking in public -- but you could have been arrested for being a "common drunkard." Most states and municipalities had laws on the books that made it illegal to be a "common drunkard" or a "vagrant," terms used to describe those who would be known today as alcoholic and homeless, respectively. The police arrested hundreds of thousands of people every year for violating these so-called vagrancy and public drunkenness laws, which were at the heart of the police's mission to control urban social disorder. Such laws defined life on Skid Row: Some perennially homeless, alcoholic men spent years of their lives in jail, in 30-day increments, on charges of public drunkenness and vagrancy.
 
 But in the late '50s and early '60s, legal scholars started to criticize how these laws were enforced, using arguments that would be familiar to anyone following the contemporary debate around drug decriminalization. Critics argued that arresting, charging and incarcerating "drunkards" wasted scarce police and court resources; that the laws were enforced more stringently against poor black people than against affluent white people; and that "public drunkenness" was a moral and medical issue better addressed in churches and hospitals than jails and courtrooms.
 
**Decriminalize Drunkeness** 1964, in its landmark decision Robinson v. California. The immediate effect of the decision was to strike down a California statute classifying drug addiction as a crime. But it also rang the death knell for all "status offenses," vagrancy chief among them. In a later decision (Powell v State of Texas, 1968), the Supreme Court chose not to strike down public drunkenness laws as unconstitutional. The court found that such laws prohibited the act of "appearing in public while drunk," rather than "being an alcoholic."

  Take-Aways:
  **Analysis of 40 Acres, pg 3**   
 American reparation planning is historically rooted in organizing and advocacy by formerly  enslaved people, their descendants, and accomplices (Aiyetoro and Davis 2009). While the 1861 Confiscation Act and Freedman’s Bureau Bills (1865-1866) are widely credited for  proposing allocations of forty-acre plots and fifty dollars to formerly enslaved families, such  federal measures were soundly reversed by congressional leaders who instead compensated  slave owners and loyal Southerners.
 
 **Goal of Reperatory Planning, pg 4**
Kelley  frames reparations “as a broad strategy to radically transform society—redistributing  wealth, creating a democratic and caring public culture, exposing the ways capitalism and  slavery produced massive inequality” (129).

**Abolistionist Planning Efforts, pg 4** 
If reparation is "abolition in action," as stated by Patrisse Cullors, cofounder of Black Lives  Matter— the decentralized political and grassroots movement most prominently leading the  contemporary struggle to abolish mass incarceration, capital punishment, and police  violence—it seems appropriate to consider reparative planning in light of abolitionist  planning debates.2 In 2017, a group of graduate students at UCLA co-facilitated a course,  "Abolitionist Planning in Today’s Political Conjuncture," and published an abolitionist  planning guide for urban planners. In response to the election of Trump, the group sought to  invoke abolition in their study and practice as a “framework for urban planning practitioners  to combat and reverse oppression of marginalized communities while also deferring to the  experiences and expertise of these communities.” The framework identifies potential  avenues to implement abolitionist planning such as community control, housing and urban  inclusivity, environmental racism and ecology, and safe streets. Subsequently, Deshonay  Dozier’s "A Response to Abolitionist Planning" (2018) raised the intractable question of  whether professional planning could actually contribute to abolition as an “institution of  harm complicit in the making of penal systems“ and as a central conduit of violence against  Indigenous, Black, Brown, Asian and poor people. Dozier’s piece conceptualizes abolition as  

**BLM Reperations Now Toolkit**
 BLM’s Reparations Now Toolkit further outlines five key components of reparations: (1) Official  acknowledgment and apology for harm, public education, or memorial about the harm; (2) Compensation to a  specific, defined group of individuals harmed by a violation, including descendants, as well as family and  community members of individuals directly targeted for harm who were adversely affected’; (3) Restitution  and Repatriation—Action to restore individuals harmed to the position they were in before the initial harm  occurred; (4) Cessation/Assurance of Non-Repetition—Action to stop the systems, institutions, and practices  causing the harm; and (5) Rehabilitation—Changes to laws, institutions, and systems aimed at ensuring that  harm will not happen again They additionally note: “reparations cannot be achieved simply through  ‘acknowledgment or an apology’ or ‘investment in underprivileged communities.”

**Shift Narrative Beyond Policing, pg 11**
ACT-LA seized this window of opportunity to shift the  narrative around transit safety beyond policing and escalate their advocacy to end Metro’s  multi-agency policing contract by 2022. As recalled by an ACT-LA organizer,

** Embodied Perspectives** A common feature of ACT-LA convenings is that the agenda includes a creative exercise that  invites participants to tap into their imagination and embodied perspectives in manifesting campaign goals. As characterized by an ACT-LA staff member, much of the work they do is  imagination work, “pushing imagination” and asking “what world do we want to live in” even  though “what could work for us doesn’t necessarily exist yet.“ For example, the public  webinar that initially framed the issue of public safety on metro began with a guided  meditation in which the facilitator asked participants to close their eyes and imagine how 

** conclusions, holistic safety 14 **
That ACT-LA's approach to reparative planning is relational and solidaristic—as opposed to  techno-managerial and professionalized—appears instructive for reparative planning  scholars and practitioners....Beyond simply critiquing how capitalist culture consumes our cities and  dehumanizes people, they are actively fighting to decommodify housing— through  inclusionary zoning and tenant protections, decommodify transit—via fare-free transit, and

demilitarize public space—by redirecting funding from multi-agency policing to investments  in care-centered spatial tactics, stewardship, programming, support services, public  education, and job creation that promote holistic safety.
