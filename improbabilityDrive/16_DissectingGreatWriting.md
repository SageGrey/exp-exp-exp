# Dissecting Great Writing

To all the following I give a _Chef's Kiss_

**You can sit by timber bamboo in the spring and watch it grow more than one inch an hour**  

--> Giving a visceral, peaceful mental image of sitting in nature to accompany a fact  
--> Gives detail of WHEN does it grows the most  
--> Gives space for us to think about this incredible fact   

_Pedestrian equivalent "Timber bamboo can grow as fast as one inch an hour"_

** **  
**There is a top ten list for the fastest growing plants in the world. And Duckweed, algea, and kudzu did not have a chance of making number one**  

--> Lets reader put 1 and 1 together by not explicitly saying the fact.   
--> Gives a sense of there being a reality that is larger than human classifications   
--> So much additional information (fits in top 4 fastest growing plants)   
--> Personifies competition for fastest growing
