# Git Hub Zettlekasten

I'm using git hub as my digital slip box for my zettlekasten. If you want to explore the whole slip box, feel free to poke around it in the [zzzzz_cards folder](https://github.com/SageGrey/exp-exp-exp/tree/main/zzzzz_cards).

You can also notice a big range of quality in the cards (it took me a minute to figure out how to use this system) for examples of a basic card see: [here](https://github.com/SageGrey/exp-exp-exp/blob/main/zzzzz_cards/201_anti-homelessPolicing_Industrialization.md), [here](https://github.com/SageGrey/exp-exp-exp/blob/main/zzzzz_cards/198_CrisisMisleadingTerm.md), or [here](https://github.com/SageGrey/exp-exp-exp/blob/main/zzzzz_cards/197_HUB__Graphic_Design_Tips.md)

**Note**: I switched this week from the open-source zettlkasten platform [ZKN](http://zettelkasten.danielluedecke.de/en/) to creating my own version manually in GitHub. If you are interested in starting a zettlekasten, I think ZKN is great[^1], I just wanted ability to play with it spatially. This conversion broke my links between cards that I am in the process of adding back in.
