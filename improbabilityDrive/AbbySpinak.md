Imaginaries from Rural Electrification to the Green New Deal,” The 
Richard Saivetz Annual Memorial Architectural Lecture, Brandeis 
University (November 2021)_
  
  ### Summary 
  * Talk grounded itself in the Glasgow protests outside of the COP conference. 
  * Discussed ideas of energy democracy and Green New Deal activism
  * Discussed the history of REA (rural electrification) and its alighnment with pro-growth mentalities
  * Conclusion is an idea that "clean energy" is flawed, we need reduction of consumption. 
  
  ### What Stood Out To Me
  

  * Idea that electricifation during REA encouraged(required) growth in part by making sure residents had access to loans to buy appliances and by putting demands on cooperatives. 
  * Electrification took women out of many of the farming tasks, creating conditions where the division of labor was such that women were away from men making decisions in the farm, and were relegated to the home. It did not however significantly reduce work. 
  * The profession of urban planning is more or less the same age as widespread electrification. 
  * Alisa Aturbe (sp?)'s work where she describes how we have a society where "spatial paradigms are made logical only by fossil fuel abundance"
  * We have seperated energy production from energy consumption. This was labled clean initially because there was not smoke at the site of consumption. 
  * USAID has spread its model of energy cooperatives to the global south. 

  **Delightful**
