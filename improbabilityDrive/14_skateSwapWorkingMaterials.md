Briefly describe your organization's history, and your objectives moving forward: (100 words max) *

How will partnership with Bikes Not Bombs improve the quality of your programs and/or services? (250 words max): 

We want to host a skate-swap this fall. 
Many folks in our communtiy have surplus gear and we want to faciliate an affordable way for folks getting into the sport to be outfitted. Affording gear is a barrier to entry for quite a few folks hoping to get started (especially for rollerskates/inlines). We thought that especially given the recent re-opening of the JP skatepark, the pavement area outside of the BikesNotBombs garage would be an ideal venue. 

How will a partnership help to address specific issues within your community or organization? (250 words max) * 
We are nervous about trying to host a skate swap (where people would be selling/bartering) in a public park, and having it in a place like Bikes Not Bombs could allow us to potentially invite donations/booths from vendors such as Orchard Skate Shop or Thuro Skate Shop. Also having TheBikesNotBomb store where folks could buy safety equipment new (helmets are not a great thing to get used) would be a huge boon.
