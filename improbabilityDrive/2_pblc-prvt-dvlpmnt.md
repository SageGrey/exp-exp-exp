[A building is a machine that makes the land pay](https://github.com/SageGrey/exp-exp-exp/blob/main/zzzzz_cards/2.BuildingsPay_CassQuotes.md)  `|| Cass Gilbert, Early 20th Century Architect`

When public housing was criticized for being inhumane (large towers) it focused on the architecture. But some of the most desirable real estate in the world is high rise, might it have to do much more with the _INVESTMENT_. --JK

### Class Notes 

       

 <details>
  <Summary> Kaydens Candid Caveats </Summary>
  
     1. Refa skills dont guarantee a succesful real estate career. Personality counts  
     2. Garbage (Data) In, Garbage Out  
     3. Play the Long Game, Don't Burn Bridges   
        (At the end of negotiations, try to leave with everyone feeling good)  
     4. Be(A)ware  the tower of babel. Ask names of terms, many things have many synonyms.

 <summary> Parts of A Pro Forma </summary> 
  
 
 [Parts of A Pro Forma](https://github.com/SageGrey/exp-exp-exp/blob/main/zzzzz_cards/203_Pro%20Forma.md)
 Latin: As a matter of form  
 Occurs in a "Stabalized Year" || Syn: Operating, Standard  
 Uses Actual, Estimated (or manipulated)  
 *Note:* (_italics_ should be underlined, can't underline in markdown)  
 
          Gross Income
          (Vacancy)
          _Additional Income_
          Effective Gross Income
          (Operating Expenses)
          (Real Estate Taxes)
          (Replacement Reserve)
          _(Other Recurring Expenses)_
          Net Operating Income
          _(Debt Services)_
          Cash Flow After Financing
          (Tax Payment)
          Cash Flow After Taxes 
          
 **Gross Income**
 
       --> Rent  
       --> Note: 
           Difference between Square Footage AND Net Rentable Square Footage  
           Percentage Rents (Some Retail pays a PERCENTAGE of sales instead of fixed rent  
           "Face Rent" vs "Effective Rent" (If Landlord gives a deal such as 1-month free)
**Additional Income**

           Vending, Laundry, Concierge, Etc. 
**Vacancy** 

     --> The unrented square feet owing to time taken to rent
     --> RENT UP PERIOD 
         example: if it takes 1/2 year to find a tenant every 12 years. 
         .5/12.5 --> 4% vacancy
     --> Looks generally at market conditions (Strong or Weak) 
     --> Can also be tenants not paying
     
**Effective Gross Income**

    --> Net Revenue
    (Face Rent + Additional) - Vacancy
    
**Operating**
    
    SCRUITINIZE THIS SECTION, CAN BE MANIPULATED V EASY
    --> Minor Repairs, Utilities
    --> Management, Broker Fees, Doormen, etc. 
    --> Expense Stops: 
        Maximum amount of expense per square foot paid by owner  
        All else paid by tenant  
        Ex: 10$/Square Foot
        
    A ROOKIE MISTAKE:
    Someone saying they will do it themselves so dont put in cost. 
    problem 1 --> what happens if they get sick
    problem 2 --> opportunity cost of their labor
    Moral: put in an imputed amount for your own labor
    
**Real Estate Taxes**
`Assessed Value of Land` x `Tax Rate` = `Property Tax`
    
     DONT CONFUSE WITH OTHER TAXES
     Property Tax
     Properties generally assessed by gov every 1-3 years
     Commercial rates tend to be higher 
        --> Home Voter Hypothesis
     Other: Annual Occupancy Taxes
     
**Replacement Reserve** 
 
     -->Major Repiars  
     --> Capital Expenditures  
     --> Tenant Fit Outs  
    
**Net Operating Income**    

     ---> Net Operaing Income (NOI)
     SYNONYMS: Cash Flow Before Financing, Free and Clear, Net Income Before Financing
     
[**Debt Service (Interest + Amortization)** ](https://github.com/SageGrey/exp-exp-exp/blob/main/zzzzz_cards/205_Debt%20Service.md)

     ---> Payments on Debt Owed
     ---> Sometimes called "Financing Payment"
     --> Debt Service = Interest + Amortization
     --> Borrow as much as possible due to "Positive Financial Leverage" (able to make more money off of your money than the interest on debt costs)
     Two Components of Debt Service
     1. DEBT --> How much debt
     2. EQUITY --> Amount Dev/Investory used to begin with
     
     Types of Loans
     1. Construction Loans
     2. Permanent Loan
     
     Conventional Mortgage Loan
     -> Mortgage vs Mortgage Loan 
     --> MOST PEOPLE THINK OF MORTGAGE AS: Type of Loan that uses real estate as collateral
     --> Mortgage is actually a LIEN
         Lien--> legal claim held by the lender on the property of the borrower
         Mortgage provides security for the lender.
         Loan is _secured_ by the mortgage
         
         
     --> Loan to Value Ratios
     Common today for Developer to recieve loans for 60% of costs to build
     
     --> Conventional Fixed-Rate Mortgage Loan
          -->Interest amount is fixed
          --> Amount paid to lender does not vary (30 year loan)
          --> You are paying "Debt Service" 
          
          --> Debt Service = Interest + Amortization 
            AmortizLoan Amount * Loan Constant
          --> Amortization = "Repayment of Mortgage Loan itself (Principle)
          --> Principle (The origianl amount that was loaned)  
          
          --> Look at a Constant Chart/Schedule 
               --> Rows (Interest Rate)  
               --> Number of Years
               
           STEPS
            1. First calculate interest payment (Outstanding Loan x Interest Rate)
            2. Take the constant mortgage payment
            Constant Mortgage Payment - Interest Payment = Amortization
            
Tax Payment Calculation** 

          Tax Payment = Taxable Income x Tax Rate
          Tax Income DOES NOT EQUAL the Tax Payment, Do this calculation in a seperate place so you don't accidentally swap them. 
          
Allowable Income **Tax Deductions** from taxable income 
          You can DEDUCT your EXPENSES from your income
          --> Mortgage loan interest (just the interest part, not the amortization)
          --> Operating Expenses
          --> Real Estate Taxes
          --> Depreciation of Property 
               --> To account for the theoretical deterioration of the property
               --> Basically a built-in subsidy              
         
         You CANNNOT DEDUCT 
          --> Amortization (This would amount to paying money to yourself, not an expense)
          --> Replacement Reserve not Deductable
          
Calculating Taxable Income (two places it can be done)
          
          NOI 
          - Interest
          - Depreciation
          + Replacement Reserves
          _______________________
          Taxable Income
          
          CFAF (cash flow after financing)
          - Depreciation
          + Amrotization
          + Replacement Reserve

Income Remaining one the debt has been serviced
--Income that is distributed to investors and limited partners who then have to pay INCOME taxes on it. 



**Return Measures (Rates of Returns)**
      
     Asset Value x Rate of Return = Income
     
     Rate of Return = Income / Asset Value
     
Return on Total Assets 

     --> Measure of profitability based on total asset cost (or value)
     --> Same as income returned, or "Free and Clear" 
     
     ROTA = NOI/Total Development Cost
     _Return on Equity_ -->
    
Return on Equity

    --> Incone returned on equity invested
    -->Also known as "Cash on Cash"
    --> If ROE is greater than ROTA you have positive leverage
    ROE = Cash Flow After Taxes/Equity Invested
    
Cap (Capitalization) Rates
    
    Market derived rates (percentages) based on market data of ratio of recently sold property NOIs and dales prices 
    Cap Rate = NOIs/Sales Price
    
    Higher the cap rate, the lower the value
    (Lower cap rate, higher value)
    
    Capitalized Value = NOI/ Cap Rate
     
take-away
`Money flows to the highest risk adjusted return`

  <Summary> Various Types of Financial Analysis </summary>
### Cost Benefit Analysis 
   
      Not super common in public private development  
      CBA seeks to measure in MONETARY TERMS net increase/decrease in goods/services taken by project for society as a whole. 
      
      PROBLEMS WITH CBA:
      --> Does not account for WHO is benefited, WHO is harmed
      --> Monetizing benefits is hard
      --> Future benefits have discount rates applied (higher discount rate, lower benefits valued) 
      
### Cost-Effectiveness Analysis
 
      Assumes the project is happening. But we would like it to be as cheap as possible
      Neccesary, Sufficient, But not excessive
      
### Modified CBA for Public-Private Development

     Looks at the DISTRIBUTION of benefits
     Doesn't monetize everything


### Economic Impact Analysis

     Also known as "regional income analysis"
     Contributuions to an economy in a specific area. 
     Uses multipliers, for every $X, there is # benefits. 
     
     Looks at: 
     Direct Spending -- How much did it cost
     Indirect Spending -- How much businesses (tenantS) spend
     Induced Spending -- How much people that have jobs as a consequence of this project will spend
     
     Problems with this kind of analysis:
     Boosterism
     Substitution Effect (This project might take away from that other project)
     Models can be faulty
     Local Economy Leakage --> Is it actually going locally?

### Fiacal Impact Analysis

         Useful for fully private projects
          --> How many new services will need to be rendered by the gov?
          --> How much new tax base revenue?

  <Summary> Who Has Power in Cities? </Summary>

 **See ZKN note:** 
  [232_7TheoriesofPower](https://github.com/SageGrey/exp-exp-exp/blob/main/zzzzz_cards/232_7TheoriesofPower.md)
    
 Elite Reputational:
This theory is based off of observations of Atlanta. The central tenant is that repuatation is essentially equal to power. So cultivating status is thus cultivating power. Who do you think is the most important person to consult is the top businessman or power broker.

Elite Structural Theory:
This theory is a more Marxist approach that argues that structural features od society (capitalism) are the determinants of who has power. This is associated with the power coming from the institutions that have societal reproduction.

Pluralist
This theory is based on observations of New Haven. Is arguing against the elite reputational theories saying that there is actually a broad base of folks who influence the city that are widely disperesed. Argues that the power of elites is exaggerated.

Historical Institutional
Essentially is an argument for path dependency. What has happened heavily shapes what will.

Public Choice Theory
This theory essentially applies neo-classical economic theory to government actors. Argues that all actors in governemnt are ultimately making choices based on their self-interest, not neccesarily the public good. definitely this meshes well with Rick Ulibarri's beliefs about politics. How is James Buchanon is associated with this idea?

Growth Machine Theory
Given that many industries are benefited by growth (developers, lawyers, ad firms, architects, etc) there is a wide-based push from corporate forces to see things built. Example is why media companies love the construction of sports stadiums.

Regime Theory
This idea comes from Clarance Stone writing about Atlanta. It is similar to Growth Machine Theory, but it combines the interests of both private and public figures, what could be called "the elites."

  <summary> 2 Administrative Models: Discretionary + As Of Right </summary>
  
  .   
 ### As of Right: _ministerial model_   
 The model where the zoning allows for development that meets pre-determined specifications. The role of the city is to evaluate a project based on these specifications. If it meets them, it is approved. 
   * Is often used in cooler markets that are trying to encourage development
   * Can be more transparent
  
 ### Discretionary
 The model where projects are approved on a case-by-case basis. The role of the city is to negotiate benefits from any project that is proposed.
   * Often used in hot markets (NYC, SF, Vancouver)
   * Can be a way for groups (such as Labor) to seek out promises

  </details>
### [Historical Timeline of Subsidies](../zzzzz_cards/235_HstrcTmln_PublicSubsidies.md)
### [Block Grants](https://github.com/SageGrey/exp-exp-exp/blob/main/zzzzz_cards/236_blockGrantVsCategorical.md)
      
### Credits vs Deductions
**Credits** the amount is subtracted from the tax bill, can be sold
**Deductions** the amount is subtracted from taxable income

Examples: $1,000 Credit/Deduction for someone at 15% tax bracket
$1,000 Credit --> $1,000 Saved
$1,000 Deduction --> $150 Saved



### LIHTC: Low Income Housing Tax Credit (Lihtec)

 ### Land Acquisition 
 
 **IN US: General land ownership breakdown**   
 60% private  
 40% gov   
 2% tribal
 
 **A few reasons why gov might buy land**
 Government might want to aquire land in order to reap the economic benefit of the infrastructure that it has invested in.   
 Government can buy land in order to create false scarcity to increase value. Can soemtimes be called **Land Banking**  
 Land acquisition as form of punishment (refusal to pay property taxes (tax forclosure), take compensation for illicit drugs, etc.)  
 For corrupt reasons! 
 
 ### Expropriations, Eminent Domain

 ### Kelo Case, 2005
 Kelo vs City of New London
 Court Case where Pfizer wanted to move in, city wanted to develop a research campus. Create jobs, tax revenue, development (common development plan). They would need to acquire 115 land parcels. They would lease to private developer for 1$ a year for 99 years. (The 1$ is for "consideration" in order to have a valid contract, not just a gift). Suzette Kelo didn't want to sell. Used eminent domain, went all the way to the supreme court. The Court **UPHELD** the use of eminent domain by slim minority (5-4). 
 
 Big Issue: Is this a **"Public Use""** (the court said yes, public purpose is public use).   
 
 Controversy: Taking Private Use "A" and moving it to private use "B." Governemnt declaring that B is more valuable than A. Dissent argued that this would mean that "any lower use of land could be subject to being flipped."  
 Other Noteworthy Elements: Eminent domain as applied to "unblighted" land, (ie the plaintiff wasn't poor).   
  
Consequence: More than 40 State legislators tightened eminent domain, clarified that eminent domain could only be used for blight, and redefined what blight is. Thus cementing the legacy that eminent domain can only be used again low-income folks. 


**"Fair Market Compensation"**: What a willing buyer would pay a willing seller. This becomes a fiction if the seller isn't willing to sell.

 ### Assume we have a can opener joke
 
                       A popular economics joke has a physicist, a chemist, and an economist all stranded on a desert island. 
                       There is one can of food, but nothing to open it with. 
                       The physicist presents his proposed solution (usually hitting the can with a rock). 
                       The chemist presents his proposed solution (such as heating a seawater solution with the sun’s rays). 
                       The economist comes up with the simple, unrealistic solution: “Assume we have a can opener...” 
                       One variant is: “Assume the can is open...”
                       
                       Source: The desert island “assume we have a can opener” joke dates to at least 1970 and possibly originated with British economists.
                       
                       
  Globally the trend in PPP, often called **Build-Operate-Transfer.** 
  
  ### Land Re-Adjustment
  Used when areas of fragmented, oddly configured development. Particularly in regard to infrastructure. 
  
  Offers promised of something _less Coercive_ than Eminent Domain. All land is pooled, redistributed. Then land is given back to members of the pool. Will get somewhat less land back. Residents will be willing since the land will be higher value.

Pattern: Depends based on country/place
Step 1: Local gov create an entity that will stage the project. The entity will then seek support from involved owners. Generally 50% + 1 of owners have to agree to pool their parcels. They then buy parcels 
Step 2: Create a plan. Set aside land for infrastructure, re-sale (to produce revenue for the project). 
Step 3: Original land is returned to owners, but in smaller amounts. 

_What about the minority that doesn't want to sell?_ They are forced to sell by the entity at an amount that does not exceed the land value of their neighbors. This is of course reminiscent of eminent domain.

Common phenomenon that eminent domain exercised, but then land is left undeveloped and homes have been bulldozed. 

**Disposition**                       
 Sale or lease of land.  
 To generate revenue.   
 Eliminate responsibilty.   
 Influence the land market.  
 
 HOW: Auction, Sole Source
 
 Auction: 
 Highest Responsible Bidder Wins
 Open Outcry
 
Gov Prepares Auction, Announces, Engages, Administers Auction. 
 Sealed Bid Auctions
 
**RFP (Request for Proposal) Method**    
STEP ONE: Gov **prepares RFP** Document,  
        
        Sometimes will use a RFQ (Request for Qualifications)
STEP TWO: Goc announces RFP  
STEP THREE: Engages with potential participants   
STEP FOUR: Gov reviews development proposal and _TENTATIVELY_ determine a winner  
STEP FIVE: Gov negotiates with the tentative winner, enters into a binding winner   

          Minor modifications permitted, major modifications are deeply problematic
          AND can result in lawsuits. 


**SOLE SOURCE METHOD**: Non-competitive process. Gov approaches one entity.
