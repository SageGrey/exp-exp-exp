# Class Notes 

#### Formatting Notes:  
       
       Section Header `### ---------->`
       Cannot do underline in markdown, treat italics as underline
       
### ----------> Vocab Bank

    **REFA** --> Real Estate Financial Analysis 
    **Underwriting** --> Analyzing the Deal 
    **NOI** --> Net Operating Income, "Free and Clear," Net Income Before Financing, Cash Flow Before Financing
    **Debt Dervice** --> Interest + Amortization
    **Positive Financial Leverage** --> When able to get a lower interest rate than what the rate of your investment growth could yield.
    **Amortization** --> "Payments of principle (the original amount that was loaned)
    **Principle** --> (The origianl amount that was loaned)   
    **Free and Clear** --> Above the debt service, "cash on cost"


### ---------->Kaydens Candid Caveats 
     
     1. Refa skills dont guarantee a succesful real estate career. Personality counts
     2. Garbage (Data) In, Garbage Out
     3. Play the Long Game, Don't Burn Bridges 
        (At the end of negotiations, try to leave with everyone feeling good)
     4. Be(A)ware  the tower of babel. Ask names of terms, many things have many synonyms. 
     
### ----------> Parts of a Pro Forma 
 Latin: As a matter of form  
 Occurs in a "Stabalized Year" || Syn: Operating, Standard  
 Uses Actual, Estimated (or manipulated)  
 *Note:* (_italics_ should be underlined, can't underline in markdown)  
 
          Gross Income
          (Vacancy)
          _Additional Income_
          Effective Gross Income
          (Operating Expenses)

          Cash Flow After Taxes 
          
 **Gross Income**
 
       --> Rent  
       --> Note: 
           Difference between Square Footage AND Net Rentable Square Footage  
           Percentage Rents (Some Retail pays a PERCENTAGE of sales instead of fixed rent  
           "Face Rent" vs "Effective Rent" (If Landlord gives a deal such as 1-month free)
**Additional Income**

           Vending, Laundry, Concierge, Etc. 
**Vacancy** 

     --> The unrented square feet owing to time taken to rent
     --> RENT UP PERIOD 
         example: if it takes 1/2 year to find a tenant every 12 years. 
         .5/12.5 --> 4% vacancy
     --> Looks generally at market conditions (Strong or Weak) 
     --> Can also be tenants not paying
     
**Effective Gross Income**

    --> Net Revenue
    (Face Rent + Additional) - Vacancy
    
**Operating**
    
    SCRUITINIZE THIS SECTION, CAN BE MANIPULATED V EASY
    --> Minor Repairs, Utilities
    --> Management, Broker Fees, Doormen, etc. 
    --> Expense Stops: 
        Maximum amount of expense per square foot paid by owner  
        All else paid by tenant  
        Ex: 10$/Square Foot
        
    A ROOKIE MISTAKE:
    Someone saying they will do it themselves so dont put in cost. 
    problem 1 --> what happens if they get sick
    problem 2 --> opportunity cost of their labor
    Moral: put in an imputed amount for your own labor
    
**Real Estate Taxes**
`Assessed Value of Land` x `Tax Rate` = `Property Tax`
    
     DONT CONFUSE WITH OTHER TAXES
     Property Tax
     Properties generally assessed by gov every 1-3 years
     Commercial rates tend to be higher 
        --> Home Voter Hypothesis
     Other: Annual Occupancy Taxes
     
**Replacement Reserve** 
 
     -->Major Repiars  
     --> Capital Expenditures  
     --> Tenant Fit Outs  
    
**Net Operating Income**    

     ---> Net Operaing Income (NOI)
     SYNONYMS: Cash Flow Before Financing, Free and Clear, Net Income Before Financing
     
[**Debt Service (Interest + Amortization)** ](https://github.com/SageGrey/exp-exp-exp/blob/main/zzzzz_cards/205_Debt%20Service.md)

     ---> Payments on Debt Owed
     ---> Sometimes called "Financing Payment"
     --> Debt Service = Interest + Amortization
     --> Borrow as much as possible due to "Positive Financial Leverage" (able to make more money off of your money than the interest on debt costs)
     Two Components of Debt Service
     1. DEBT --> How much debt
     2. EQUITY --> Amount Dev/Investory used to begin with
     
     Types of Loans
     1. Construction Loans
     2. Permanent Loan
     
     Conventional Mortgage Loan
     -> Mortgage vs Mortgage Loan 
     --> MOST PEOPLE THINK OF MORTGAGE AS: Type of Loan that uses real estate as collateral
     --> Mortgage is actually a LIEN
         Lien--> legal claim held by the lender on the property of the borrower
         Mortgage provides security for the lender.
         Loan is _secured_ by the mortgage
         
         
     --> Loan to Value Ratios
     Common today for Developer to recieve loans for 60% of costs to build
     
     --> Conventional Fixed-Rate Mortgage Loan
          -->Interest amount is fixed
          --> Amount paid to lender does not vary (30 year loan)
          --> You are paying "Debt Service" 
          
          --> Debt Service = Interest + Amortization 
            AmortizLoan Amount * Loan Constant
          --> Amortization = "Repayment of Mortgage Loan itself (Principle)
          --> Principle (The origianl amount that was loaned)  
          
          --> Look at a Constant Chart/Schedule 
               --> Rows (Interest Rate)  
               --> Number of Years
               
           STEPS
            1. First calculate interest payment (Outstanding Loan x Interest Rate)
            2. Take the constant mortgage payment
            Constant Mortgage Payment - Interest Payment = Amortization
            
Tax Payment Calculation** 

          Tax Payment = Taxable Income x Tax Rate
          Tax Income DOES NOT EQUAL the Tax Payment, Do this calculation in a seperate place so you don't accidentally swap them. 
          
Allowable Income **Tax Deductions** from taxable income 
          You can DEDUCT your EXPENSES from your income
          --> Mortgage loan interest (just the interest part, not the amortization)
          --> Operating Expenses
          --> Real Estate Taxes
          --> Depreciation of Property 
               --> To account for the theoretical deterioration of the property
               --> Basically a built-in subsidy              
         
         You CANNNOT DEDUCT 
          --> Amortization (This would amount to paying money to yourself, not an expense)
          --> Replacement Reserve not Deductable
          
Calculating Taxable Income (two places it can be done)
          
          NOI 
          - Interest
          - Depreciation
          + Replacement Reserves
          _______________________
          Taxable Income
          
          CFAF (cash flow after financing)
          - Depreciation
          + Amrotization
          + Replacement Reserve
          _____________________
          Taxable Income 
          
    
    
TASK 1
`Put in Loan Payments Diagram`

TASK 2 
`Put Amortization Calculations into a Zettle Note`


Income Remaining one the debt has been serviced
--Income that is distributed to investors and limited partners who then have to pay INCOME taxes on it. 



**Return Measures (Rates of Returns)**
      
     Asset Value x Rate of Return = Income
     
     Rate of Return = Income / Asset Value
     
Return on Total Assets 

     --> Measure of profitability based on total asset cost (or value)
     --> Same as income returned, or "Free and Clear" 
     
     ROTA = NOI/Total Development Cost
     _Return on Equity_ -->
    
Return on Equity

    --> Incone returned on equity invested
    -->Also known as "Cash on Cash"
    --> If ROE is greater than ROTA you have positive leverage
    ROE = Cash Flow After Taxes/Equity Invested
    
Cap (Capitalization) Rates
    
    Market derived rates (percentages) based on market data of ratio of recently sold property NOIs and dales prices 
    Cap Rate = NOIs/Sales Price
    
    Higher the cap rate, the lower the value
    (Lower cap rate, higher value)
    
    Capitalized Value = NOI/ Cap Rate
     
take-away
`Money flows to the highest risk adjusted return`
     
           
         
`FUZZY ON` 
[--Cap Rates why the higher cap rate, lower value]
[-- ROE vs ROTA]
