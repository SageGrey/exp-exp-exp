NOTES: 
Discuss subsidy options/types in the write-ups. For the real estate financial analysis, be sure that Lump Sum Subsidy and Annual Subsidy are logically located within the structure of the Discounted Cash Flow. However, specific subsidy options do not need to be separately modeled. Put another way, do model annual subsidy vs. lump sum subsidy, but there is no need to model tax abatement vs. rent subsidy vs. sustainable building material grants, etc.
