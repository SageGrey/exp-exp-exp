# RABALDER PARK RESEARCH

**Guidelines**: Applicants should submit a one‐ or two‐page proposal focusing on projects that relate to **real estate**, urban and economic development, ESG, housing, **the built environment**, or history, culture, and preservation. Research relating to  social considerations and poverty amelioration are welcome. A brief budget proposal and a current resume should accompany all submissions.

##  Draft
To whom it may concern,
I assume that anyone likely to read this proposal will have long ago concluded that as a society we need to prepare our built environment for the drastic changes caused by climate change. Given that in 30 years sea levels are likely to be as much as a foot above where they are now (as was predicted in NOAA's report released earlier this month) and "100-year storms" are likely to become annual events--it is crystal clear that virtually all built environments will need to build new adaptive infrastructure. What is far from clear, however, is what exactly this infrastructure will look like.
I am writing to this group to seek funding to study what I find to be an exceptionally intriguing example of flood infrastructure–Rabalder Skate Park in Roskilde, Denmark. Built by architect Søren Nordal Enevoldsen with Nordarch Architecture in 20121, "Rabalderparken" collects rainwater from nearby streets in Roskilde and,  using a series of channels and tunnels,  funnels the water into a 23,000 square meter bowl with the holding capacity of ten competition swimming pools. The system is a part of the city’s flash flood system but also functions as a large public park for the city. In the years following the completion of the project, Rabalderparken garnered a ripple of media attention from international news outlets, skate culture magazines, and sustainable design competitions. The work has also appeared briefly in various academic and popular works documenting sustainable design.
As the park reaches a decade of operation, I wish to delve into the conditions that led to its creation as well as to develop a better understanding of how it has functioned over the last 10 years. I see this research as the starting point for my Urban Planning thesis on the connections between building climate adaptation infrastructure and robust networks for play. One tragic point that affects this research is that Søren Enevoldsen passed away unexpectedly in July of 2021. This complicates the research, while also underscoring the importance of capturing this story while it is still fresh in the minds of the community that saw it come to fruition.

### Guiding Questions:
 
#### How did it happen?
What coalitions and institutions were crucial in the conception, development, and implementation of the project.
What were the obstacles that had to be overcome?
 
#### Is it a success?
Do local officials and residents consider the project to have a meaningful role in contributing to flood infrastrucutre? 
Do locals think that it provides meaningful public space?
Do skaters like it?

#### How is the park maintained? 
Who maintains the park in theory? 
Who actually does the most work to keep it going/funded?
Are there any threats to its continued operation?
 
### Project Plan
#### May - June (remote)
Translate and digest current materials written about Rabalderparken   
Identify and inititate contact with:    
 ---> Government officials in Roskilde      
 ---> Ole Skjelmose and other past members of Nordarch Architecture (Using LinkedIn as the key resource)   
 ---> Owner/Manager/Employees of Merch Fabrikken (Local Skate Shop)   
#### July (Roskilde/Copenhagen)
Observe Rabaldenpark over 2-4 Days  
Skate at Rabaldenpark and around Roskilde  
Conduct Walking Interviews with identified contacts  
Attend 'Friday Night Skate' in Copenhagen (a weekly event that attracts lots of inline skaters http://www.fns-cph.dk/en/home.html)


### Budget 
#### Requested Budget:
$925 ----- Roundtrip Flights to Copenhagen (includes fees for checking a second suitcase for skate gear)  
$885 ----- Two weeks lodging in Copenhagen/Roskilde  
$65 ----- CopenhagenCard (would cover all transit costs between Roskilde and Copenhagen)  
$125 ----- 5 Hours of translation services for interviewees who do not speak English  
 
Total: $2,000
 
#### Ideal Budget:
All above costs plus    
 $50 ----- Budget for buying coffee/tea for walking interview subjects     
$150 ----- Additional 6 hours of translation services   
 
Total: $2,200 

#### Closing Notes
Part of my interest in this subject comes from my experience and love for the arroyos and acequias (drainage ditches) of the Southwest. I actually first learned how to skate in the arroyos. Growing up in Albuquerque, I lived in a city where drainage was a cherished part of the neighborhood. Walking trails line the arroyos as they curve towards the mountains, young families play in the shade of small residential bridges, paved trails along the larger arroyos provide safe cycling passageways in an otherwise car-dominated terrain. I remember vividly the frustration I felt when I moved to the Bay Area for college and found these civic amenities locked off behind chain-link fences. Of course, there are trade-offs--every few years in Albuquerque  there would be a story of a flash-flood victim—but overwhelmingly, the arroyos were a feature of the city that created safe places for recreation and socialization. As we barrel towards a startling new reality and attempt to move society to prepare for it, I believe we would be wise to pay attention and learn from the moments where we can find resilience and joy in what is otherwise simply considered an unfortunate "necessity."
