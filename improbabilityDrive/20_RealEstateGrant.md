# RABALDER PARK RESEARCH

**Guidelines**: Applicants should submit a one‐ or two‐page proposal focusing on projects that relate to **real estate**, urban and economic development, ESG, housing, **the built environment**, or history, culture, and preservation. Research relating to  social considerations and poverty amelioration are welcome. A brief budget proposal and a current resume should accompany all submissions.

##  Draft

To whom it may concern, 

I assume that anyone likely to be reading this proposal will have long ago reached the conclusion that as a society we need to prepare our built environment for the drastic changes caused by climate change. Given that in 30 years sea levels are likely to be as much as a foot above where they are now (as was predicted in NOAA's report released earlier this month) and "100-year storms" are likely to become annual events--it is crystal clear that virtually all built environments will need to create new adaptive infrastructure. What is far from clear, however, is what exactly this infrastructure will look like. 

I am writing to this group to seek funding to study what I find to be an exceptionally intriguing example of flood infrastructure--Rabalder Skate Park in Roskilde, Denmark. Built by architect Søren Nordal Enevoldsen with Nordarch Architecture in 2012[^2], "Rabalderparken" collects rainwater from nearby streets in Rosklide and funnels them, using a series of channels and tunnels, into a 23,000 square metre bowl with the holding capacity of ten competition swimming pools[^4]. The system is a part of the cities flash flood system, but also functions as a large public park for the city. In the years following the completion of the project, Rabalderparken garnered a ripple of media attention from international news outlets, skate culuture magazines and sustainable design competitions[^5], the work has also appeared briefly in various academic and popular works documenting sustainable design[^6].  

As the park reaches a decade of operation, I wish to delve into the conditions that led to its creation as well as to develop a better understanding of how it has functioned over the last 10 years. I see this reasearch as the starting point for my Urban Planning thesis on the connections between building climate resilient architecture and robust networks for play. One tragic point that affects this research is that Søren Enevoldsen passed away unexpectedly in July of 2021 [^3]. This evidently complicates the research, while also underscoring the importance of capturing this story while it is still fresh in the minds of the community that saw it come to fruition. 

Guiding Questions:
 
 --> **How did it happen?** 
What coalitions and institutions were crucial in the conception, development, and implementation of the project. 
What were the obstacles that had to be overcome?
 
 --> **Is it a success?** 
Do local officials and residents consider the projec to have a meaningful role in contributing to flood infrastrucutre?
Do locals think that it provides meaningful public space?
Do skaters like it?

--> **How is it maintained** 
 How is is the project being maintained? 
 Are there any threats to its continued operation?
