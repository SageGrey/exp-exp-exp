## CANONICAL AUTHORS
Susan Leigh Star --> New professional society, "society of people interested in boring things"


**ABBY**: I do not hold a contradiction between rigorous research and politically motivated research. 

**Citations** as infrastrucutre, radical transparency. Pay attention to who is citing who. 

Cowen + Wilson cite --> Star who cites --> Winner


PROMPTS FOR DISCUSSION

        1.	Infrastructure as a Thing. First, introduce yourselves and say what “infrastructure” brought you to this class. 

       2.  Then, thinking about all those infrastructures together, along with the readings, consider: 

          3. What is infrastructure? How should we study it? At what scale? 

           4. You may wish to look together at Leigh Star’s typologies of infrastructure – pg. 381-2 – and discuss whether you understand and agree with her definition of infrastructure through those 9 characteristics. Is there anything you would add? 

           5. Finally, considering Winner, please discuss: What are the politics of infrastructure as you have collectively defined it? Which politics are embedded in infrastructures – that is, they “derive from an unavoidable social responsibility to intractable properties in the things themselves” (Winner 131) – and which are imposed – that is, “certain widely accepted reasons of practical necessity...have tended to eclipse other sorts of moral and political reasoning" (133) in their design?
