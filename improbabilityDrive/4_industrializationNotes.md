#### Whats happening in England
22yr old Friederich Engels goes to Manchester to work in the family business and after work starts documenting what he sees. He becomes interested in what he calles the **Spatial Fix** or accumulation of fixed capital.  
In essence, investments are fixed by locking their value into land and buildings. 
In his notes about the seperation of classes in the city, he believes that it was an accident. He believes that the factories moving into the cities prompted the rich to leave, leaving a vacuum for poor to move in. However while the form wasn't planned, he believes the concealment was. 


David Madden describes the age of industrialization the **Paleotechnic Age** at the 1820s-1900s characterized by the use of Coal, Steam and Iron

Impact of [Spinning Jenny](https://github.com/SageGrey/exp-exp-exp/blob/main/zzzzz_cards/202_SpinningJenny.md) 

First wave of industrialization was **tethered to water power** 
              
              --> Dispersed Across England Along Rivers
              --> Manufacturers had to build housing in towns`

The introduction of **Watts Steam Engine (1700-1840s)** severed this connection to water

             --> Factories consolidated in large population centers. One of the problems for the capitalists of providing housing in rural spaces was that if there was a slump, their workers would stop paying rent at their boarding houses. Moving to cities made the capitalists no longer dependent on rents from workers. 
             --> Capitalists didnt need to provide housing
 
 At the same time, The **Dissapearance of the Open Field System** in the late 18th century through **Enclosure Acts** led to lands being restrited to the owner. As a consequence, many who would have been farming were cut off and needed new employment, leading to a new workforce that could move to the cities. 
 
 This shift to cities launched the beginnings of what would become the **speculative housing market**
   
 **Pillars of the Cotton Kingdom**
     --> 1. Destruction of the Guilds
     --> 2. Establishment of open markets for labor
     --> 3. Intl dependency on slave labor

~1865 once slums were visible, there became a desire to hide them away with the development of [**Improvement Schemes**](https://github.com/SageGrey/exp-exp-exp/blob/main/zzzzz_cards/212_ImprovementSchemes.md) which are in many ways a pre-cursor to urban renewal schemes. The stated intentions were to improve circulation, etc.
