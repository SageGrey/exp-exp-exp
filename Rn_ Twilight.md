<h1 style="font-size: 40;">  <p style="text-align: center">  <b> (a few) THEMES </b></p></h1>

* **Who Gets To Be a Victim:**
	In *Twilight : Los Angeles, 1992* we see the way in which Black (and to a lesser extent, Korean) individuals are refused the status of victimhood that is readily given to white folks.  The white truck driver Reginald Denny inspired enormous media. Latasha Harlins, the 15-year-old black girl killed by a Korean shop owner in 1991 is not. Other examples in the comparison of the white college students, real estate agents, film production staff who were "scared" to the Korean shopkeepers. 


* **Intersectionality**
	Hispanics and Koreans in the play also see themselves being hurt by white supremacy, but there is a lack of intersectionality. In the original book, Rudy Salas opens the play by describing his realization that he has "an enemy, those nice white teachers." The false promise that Hispanic/Asian communities to follow other minorities' path "into whiteness" is shown as one of the barriers to collective struggle.  

* **White Man Charisma**
	At least in this production, there is a repeated portrayal of White Men with power wielding charismatic charm. Police Chiefs, Senators, seeming to be sympathetic to the struggle while staying away from the fray.

* **Difference between Hope and Optimism** 
Optimism is looking at the reality and thinking that things might turn out well, hope is looking at the reality, acknowledging that it does not look good and embracing hope anyways. 

* **Riot is the voice of the Unheard**
A riot as a roar, as a voice of the oppressed. 


##### Thoughts about the Production 
1. The more things change, the more things stay the same 
*(but maybe some things do change a little)*

In a scene towards the end of the second act, the play includes an interview, not from the original 1992 era, but from the present BlackLivesMatter-George Floyd-PostCovid Era. While so much of the play is striking in how little the narrative has changed, this interview with a veteran reporter speaks about how the broader cultural understanding of the struggle for justice has changed *(I can't find an updated script online and don't remember who this reporter is)).* The reporter describes that difference by looking at how the perception of the struggle and riots has meaningfully shifted, with 'white folks spray painting Black Lives Matter on their driveway.' This scene  reminded me of an interview that Ezra Klein did in June 2020 with Ta-Nehisi Coates. In the interview, Klein asked What Coates sees right now when he looked at America and Coates responded by describing the difference between the response to protests in the summer of 2020 and summer 1968. The hope in both instances is a measured, subtle one. But the underlying argument is that while so much has stayed the same, there are some shifts that have been made. 

```
**Ta-Nehisi Coates**
I can’t believe I’m gonna say this, but I see hope. I see progress right now, at this moment.

I had an interesting call on Saturday with my dad, who was born in 1946, grew up dirt poor in Philadelphia, lived in a truck, went off to Vietnam, came back, joined the Panther Party, and was in Baltimore for the 1968 riots. Would’ve been about 22 at that time.

I asked him if he could compare what he saw in 1968 to what he was seeing now. And what he said to me was there was no comparison — that this is much more sophisticated. And I say, well, what do you mean? He said it would have been like if somebody from the turn of the 20th century could see the March on Washington.

The idea that black folks in their struggle against the way the law is enforced in their neighborhoods would resonate with white folks in Des Moines, Iowa, in Salt Lake City, in Berlin, in London — that was unfathomable to him in ’68, when it was mostly black folks in their own communities registering their great anger and great pain.

I don’t want to overstate this, but there are significant swaths of people and communities that are not black, that to some extent have some perception of what that pain and that suffering is. I think that’s different.

2. That dinner party scene blew my mind. The idea to put the interviews into a conversation that never happened was moving.
