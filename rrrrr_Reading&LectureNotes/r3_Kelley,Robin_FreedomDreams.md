### **Quotes:** 

**Preface/Foreward**
> Without new visions we don’t know what to build, only what to knock down. We not only end up confused, rudderless, and cynical, but we forget that making a revolution is not a series of clever maneuvers and tactics but a process that can and must transform us. (Preface, I) 

> In describing the work of  Lauren Halsey’s exhibits]...”Her “freedom dreams” are not petit-bourgeois exercises of describing utopias on “post-it” notes from the safety of a museum or university and leaving on a spiritual high with no obligation to struggle. She sees in everyday people, in the Black working class, the potential to make the future by mapping where they have been, what they remember and carry, what they discard, and how they continually struggle, survive and create. “I’m not interested in escapism,” she explained/ “I’m interested in creating legible, real representations of who we were centuries ago or five minutes ago, and of who we can become five seconds from now or one hundred years from now. (xviii)

  >   “Certainly, queer and trans liberation means more than visibility or rights, or even the end of capitalism, racism, ableism, violence, and was, but new ways of being that center joy and pleasure (xxxiii)” 

**When History Sleeps: A Beginning**
> * "**My mother taught us that the Marvelous was free --- in the patterns of a stray bird feather, in a Hudson River sunset, in the view from our fire escape, in the stories she told us, in the way she sang Gershwin's "Summertime," in a curbside rainbow created by the alchemy of motor oil and water from an open hydrant. She simply wanted us to live through our thir eyes, to see life as a possibility.**  She wanted us to imagine a world free of patriarchy, a world where gender and sexual relations could be reconstructed. she wanted us to see the poetic and the prophetic in the richness of our daily lives. She wanted us to visualize a more expansive, fluid, "cosmos-politan" definition of Blackness, to teach us that we are not merely inheritors of a culture, but its makers. -pg 2"Progressive social movement do not simply produce statistics and narratives of opression; rather, the best ones do what great poetry always does: transport us to another place, compel us to relive horrors and, more importantly, enable us to imagine a new society" - pg 9 
> * Sometimes I think the conditions of daily life, of everyday oppressions, of survival, not to mention the temporary pleasures accessible to most of us, render much of out imagination intert. We are constantly putting out fires, responding to emergencies, finding temporary refuge, all of which make it diificult to see anything other than the present. As the great poet Keorapetse Kgositsile put it, "When the clouds clear/ We shall know the colour of the sky." When movements have been unable to clear the clouds, it has been the poets--no matter the medium-- who have succeeded in imagining the color of the sky, in rendering the kinds of dreams and futures social movements are capable of producing. Knowing the color of the sky is far more important than counting clouds. Or to put it another way, **the most radical art is not protest art but works that take us to another place, envision a different way of seeing, peerhaps a different way of feeling.** This is what poet Askia Muhammad TOure meant when, in a 1964 article in Liberator magazine, he called Black rhythm-and-blues artists "poet philospohers"and described their music as a "potent weapon in the Black freedom struggle."For Toure, the "movement" was more than sit-ins at lnch counters, voter registration campaigns, and freedom rides; it was about self-transformation, changing the way we think, live, love and handle pain. WHile the music frequently negatively mirrored the larger culture, it nonetheless helped generate community pride, challenged racial self-hatred, and built self-respect. It created a world of pleasure, not just to escape the everyday brutalities of capitalism, patriarchy and white supremance, but to build commounity, establish felowship, play and laugh, and plant seeds for a different way of living, a different way of hearing. As Amiri Baraka put it in his famous essay, "The Changing Same," Black music has the potential to usher in a new future based on love: "The change to Love. The freedom to (of) Love." -11
> * "Freedom and love may be the most revolutionary ideas available to us, and yet as intellectuals we have failed miserably to grapple with their political and analytical importance." --11


  

### Foreward
**Key Arguments**: There are a lot of folks who are doing liberatory work and have done liberatory work since the first publication of this book. This book grounds a fight for liberation.

### Preface
**Key Argument**: There should be room for a text that is about what we want, not just what what we dont have.

### Chapter 1: When History Sleeps: A Beginning

**Key Argument:** The Marvelous is free. The thing that is special about the poets, social movment, and black radical imagination is not just to make protest art, but to create visions of how we could be.

### Chapter 2: Dreams of The New Land
**Key Argument** Black intellectuals and activists have looked to Escape/Exodous narratives as a way to envision a new way of being free from opression. Africa (and other stand-ins) has been imagined as a utopia, free from strife or the ills of the colonized world where Black Empires once existed.  The UNIA was an example of this desire for exodous, it was limited by its sexism. Black Zionism looked to defending africa as aking to defending black women. In the late 19th/early 20th century interest in Ethiopia shows an interest in self-determination and the imagination of black empires. The promise of Liberia as a place free of tyranny was complicated by the re-enactment of tyranny aided by the Firestone Rubber company. Sun Ra and Hip Hops embrace of sci-fi and cosmos a new take on the Back to Africa dreams and imagination.
