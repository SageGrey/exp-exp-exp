Quotes: 

  

Without new visions we don’t know what to build, only what to knock down. We not only end up confused, rudderless, and cynical, but we forget that making a revolution is not a series of clever maneuvers and tactics but a process that can and must transform us. (Preface, I) 

  

In describing the work of  Lauren Halsey’s exhibits]...”Her “freedom dreams” are not petit-bourgeois exercises of describing utopias on “post-it” notes from the safety of a museum or university and leaving on a spiritual high with no obligation to struggle. She sees in everyday people, in the Black working class, the potential to make the future by mapping where they have been, what they remember and carry, what they discard, and how they continually struggle, survive and create. “I’m not interested in escapism,” she explained/ “I’m interested in creating legible, real representations of who we were centuries ago or five minutes ago, and of who we can become five seconds from now or one hundred years from now. (xviii)

  
  

“Certainly, queer and trans liberation means more than visibility or rights, or even the end of capitalism, racism, ableism, violence, and was, but new ways of being that center joy and pleasure (xxxiii)”
