As women, we have been taught either to ignore our differences or to view them as causes for separation and suspicion rather than as forces for change.

Without community, there is no liberation, only the most vulnerable and temporary armistice between an individual and her oppression. But community must not mean a shedding of our differences, nor the pathetic pretense that
these differences do not exist. -26


Women of today are still being called upon to stretch across the gap of male
ignorance and to educate men as to our existence and our needs. This is an old
and primary tool of all oppressors to keep the oppressed occupied with the
master's concerns. Now we hear that it is the task of black and third world
women to educate white women, in the face of tremendous resistance, as to our

existence, our differences, our relative roles in our joint survival. This is a diver-
Sion of energies and a tragic repetition of racist patriarchal thought. -27

for change. For women, this has meant a
suppression of the erotic as a considered source
of power and information within our lives.
We have been taught to suspect this
resource, vilified, abused, and devalued within

Western society. On the one hand, the superfi-
cially erotic has been encouraged as a sign of
female inferiority; on the other hand, women
have been made to suffer and to feel both con-
temptible and suspect by virtue of its existence.

It is a short step from there to the false
belief that only by the suppression of the erotic
within our lives and consciousness can women
be truly strong. But that strength is illusory,
for it is fashioned within the context of male
models of power. As women, we have come to distrust that power which rises from our deepest and non-
rational knowledge. We have been warned against it all our lives by the male world,
which values this depth of feeling enough to
keep women around in order to exercise it in
the service of men, but which fears this same
depth too much to examine the possibility of it
within themselves. So women are maintained
at a distant/inferior position to be psychically
milked, much the same way ants maintain

colonies of aphids to provide a life-giving sub-
stance for their masters.

But the erotic offers a well of replenishing
and provocative force to the woman who does
not fear its revelation, nor succumb to the
belief that sensation is enough.

The erotic has often been misnamed by men
and used against women. It has been made into
the confused, the trivial, the psychotic, the plasticized sensation. For this reason, we have often turned away from the exploration and consideration of the erotic as a source of power and

information, confusing it with its opposite,
the pornographic. But pornography is a direct
denial of the power of the erotic, for it represents
the suppression of true feeling. Pornography
emphasizes sensation without feeling.

The erotic is a measure between the begin-
nings of our sense of self and the chaos of our

strongest feelings. It is an internal sense of

satisfaction to which, once we have experi-
enced it, we know we can aspire. For having

experienced the fullness of this depth of feeling

and recognizing its power, in honor and self-
respect we can require no less of ourselves.

It is never easy to demand the most from
ourselves, from our lives, from our work. To
encourage excellence is to go beyond the
encouraged mediocrity of our society is to
encourage excellence. But giving in to the fear
of feeling and working to capacity is a luxury
only the unintentional can afford, and the
unintentional are those who do not wish to
guide their own destinies.

This internal requirement toward excel-
lence which we learn from the erotic must not

be misconstrued as demanding the impossible
from ourselves nor from others. Such a
demand incapacitates everyone in the process.
For the erotic is not a question only of what
we do; it is a question of how acutely and fully
we can feel in the doing. Once we know the
extent to which we are capable of feeling that
sense of satisfaction and completion, we can

then observe which of our various life endeav-
ors brings us closest to that fullness.

The aim of each thing which we do is to
make our lives and the lives of our children

richer and more possible. Within the celebra-
tion of the erotic in all our endeavors, my

work becomes a conscious decision—a longed-
for bed which I enter gratefully and from

which I rise up empowered.

Of course, women so empowered are dan-
gerous. So we are taught to separate the erotic

demand from most vital areas of our lives
other than sex. And the lack of concern for the
erotic root and satisfactions of our work is felt
in our disaffection from so much of what we
do. For instance, how often do we truly love
our work even at its most difficult?
The principal horror of any system which
defines the good in terms of profit rather than
in terms of human need, or which defines
human need to the exclusion of the psychic

and emotional components of that need—the
principal horror of such a system is that it robs
our work of its erotic value, its erotic power
and life appeal and fulfillment. Such a system
reduces work to a travesty of necessities, a
duty by which we earn bread or oblivion for

ourselves and those we love. But this is tanta-
mount to blinding a painter and then telling

her to improve her work, and to enjoy the act
of painting. It is not only next
