"knowlege was suddenly about information only. It had no relation to how one lived, behaved" (3)

"It surprised and shocked me to sit in classes where professors were not excited about teaching, where they did not seem to have a clue that education was about the practice of freedom. During college, the primary lesson was reinforced: we were to learn obedience to authority" (4)

""**The banking system of education** (based on the assumptwn
that memorizing information and regurgitating it represented
gaining knowledge that could be deposited, stored and us~~ at
a later date) did not interest me."" (5)


"The first paragidm that shaped my pedagogy was the idea that the classroom should be an exciting place, never boring." (7)

 Excitement is generated through collective effort (8)
 
"praxis"-action and reflection upon the
world in order to change it.  (9)

"Gloria had only mentioned the entire episode once after it
was over, and this to tell me simply that there are many kinds of
choices, many kinds of logic. I could make those events mean
whatever I wanted as long as I was honest." (20)
