**NYC Transit History**

Despite the association of NYC as a city shaped by public transit, the urban form of NYC was actually set by walking. In contrast, Los Angeles was a city shaped by transit that later gave way to highway development. 

```

**1832-1917 The Horse Railway**
	* First line opened 1832
	* 12 Horse Railway by 1860
	* Major Complaints: Congestion + Crowding
	* Had a regulation that mandated a 5 cent fare (nickle fares)

**Beach Pneumatic Railway**
* Alfred Beach. Constructed for mail delivery system. 
* Demonstrated in 1870
* Had a charter in 1873, financial crisis, is abandoned 1874

**Husted Act of 1875**
* Start to see a public interest in planning.  At this point, Route Planning more about approving routes (where busiest). 
* Route planning was more about approving routes that providers wanted to have

Abram Hewitt 1888 call for public investment

William Steinway and the **Rapid Transit Act of 1891**
* Same Steinway as the Pianos 


Two Competing Proposals 1894: 
	**Wilson Proposal,** City loans developer 2/3 of construction costs
	**Hewitt/Chamber of Proposal:** Municipal ownership, private management

**This Era talks:** 
	**Public Sector:** Faciliate urban growth by serving outlying areas. Transit could create sprawl, open up land for development that wasn't walkable. 
	**Private Sector** Goal: Standing Room only train cars in high-density ares. 

1940: Under Fiorello LaGuardia consolidated the three systems into one system.

*Non-ZKN Notes:*
- That travel is a **derived demand** for activity is an axiomatic belief among transportation professions. But the question, would you teleport if given the option challenges this assumption. 

- There is a difference in acceptable times when walking or using a motorized option. People are often wIlling to have a 1-hr motorized commute but not an 1-hr walk. 

- Cyclist: Safety in numbers effect. 

- Trend in cars have become safer for passengers and more dangerous for everyone outside of the car.

* ***Cost Benefit Analysis** does not account for the distribution of benefits. 
* Often however we instead start with a **cool project idea** that is justified later with other objectives. 



real vs pecuniary
direct vs indirect
tangible vs intangible

user vs non-user
total vs incremental: one alternative compared to doing nothing


IN GENERAL, exclude

* tolls
* parking charges
* Fuel taxes and other user fees
* insurance costs

BLUE BIKE CERTIFIED

**Discount rate** is the time value of money. Inflation, Opportunity costs, Risk

|PAYMENT TODAY| PAYMENT NEXT YEAR |
|---|---|
|100|100|
|100|105|

Intergenerational Equity, makes sense to finance big investments like rail with debt since it will benefit future generations. 

Reference Cost Forecasting; instead of using bottom-up estimates, you can use the costs per mile of other projects. Or provide a justification for why it is cheaper. This can help combat the optimism in cost estimation. 

Robert Moses notorious for underbudgeting in order to start projects knowing that there is reputational cost associated with stopping a project once the first stake is gone. 

Complicating the comparisson of a nyc and parisian rail line include differences in ada standards and healthcare costs for labor in the us.

**NET PRESENT VALUE;** benefits minus costs
**BENEFIT TO COST RATIO;** benefits / costs 
**INTERNAL RATE OF RETURN**; the discount rate that would give you an NPV of 0. 
**PAYBACK PERIOD**; how long before you get a positive net present value
**COST EFFECTIVENESS** cost per unit of a particular benefit


1$ to get $10 the same as $1,000,000. to get $1,000,009

## Equity 

```
> Inputs --> Outputs --> Benefits
> eg. How do you collect revenue --> Delivering Mobility --> Use of the System 
```

**Metrics**
``` 
Efficiency = Output/Input = Output/$ 
Effectiveness = Benefits/Output = Ridership/Vehicle Revenue Mile (VRM)
Cost Effectiveness = Benefits/Input =Ridership/$
```

### Base of Equity
**Place-Based Equity**
Politicians are based on place (not someone representing the millennials, baby boomers, etc.)

**People Based Equity**
Focusing on specific population 

What is the "right" distribution? (This is a branch of moral philosophy). 
	* Utilitarianism (Jeremy Bentham/Greatest Good For Greatest Number Of People)
	* Strict Egalitarianism (Karl Marx, From each according to their ability to each to their need) Distribute Equally
	* Libertarianism (Robert Nozick), Markets work well, allow people to make their own decisions. About the process. 
	* Pareto Efficiency (Vilefrido Pareto)
	* Difference Principle (John Rawls) Inequality is justified if the result of that inequality makes everyone better off. (ie justification for income inequality).
	* Capabilities Approach (Amarty Sen/Martha Nassbaum) (from wikipedia) is a normative approach to human [welfare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welfare "Welfare") that concentrates on the actual capability of persons to achieve lives they value rather than solely having a [right](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right "Right") or [freedom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom "Freedom") to do so. Concerned with adequacy. 
	* Equal Opportunity 

>> 

> **What would be needed in order to optimize Bluebike stations according to these different philosophies of "right distribution"**
> 
	Utilitarianism: Bluebike stations put at locations where they would be used by the greatest number of people. 
	What you would need: Knowledge about where bike demand is highest. 
	How could you get this: You could look at current demand and makes guesses, as well as conducting service to see where folks would like to see demand. 
	Worst Case: 

	Capabilities Approach: Bluebike stations within a 10 minute walk of every address in Boston proportional to the population of that area
	What you would need/How you could get it: Create walksheds of stations and layer over population demographics. 

	Libertarianism: Bluebike stations where they would be used the most with least need for station rebalancing. 

### Ways to Pay For Transportation

| __| Save + Wait| Borrow |
|---|---|---|
|User Fees||
|Sales Tax|||
|Income Tax|||
|Property Tax|||
|Tax-Increment Financing|||
|Federal Funds||
|Private Investment|| 

Arguments for Borrowing: Future generations will be better off than we are, future generations will benefit from the infrastructure, decently easy for government to print money. People who live in a place once the infrastructure is constructed. 

Arguments for Wait + Save: (Doesn't Really Happen) Future generations might not value what we value 

Printing Money: A form of taxation (because of inflation)

### Facilitation
-   Think about a time when you successfully learned something that was related to a professional role. Which of the features of effective professional learning were in place? How did those features support your learning?

* Modeling (post-it notes)
* Practice Lessons 
* Peer Feedback

*Notes* I had trouble accessing both readings and the Plus/Delta Feedback form due to broken links. 



 facilitation manoevers**

**getting attention;**
- hand raise
- distinctive sounds

**giving directions**
- don't do it just yet

**morale building**
*- exercise with photos and personal stories* #AddToZKN 
	 -timekeeper 2 min per person 
	 -modeling at the start of class and key pointers on the board
	 -collecting photos in advance
	 - trade-offs small group or whole group

**learning commitments 9norms0**
- asking for them in advance---not doing them in the moment
- revisiting them 


**dealing with 'this is a waste of time' issues**
- throw it to the group
- use humor
- give that person a leadership position/talk with them

**universal design for learning** 

**techniques**
-write out a scenario, think for 1 min, turn-and-talk for 5 minutes
- instead of canvas posts, have sent to a teacher. have them weave it into their lectures/presentation. 
 
- Snowball 
		- have individuals review on their own
		- have them discuss in pair
		- have them discuss in group of 4 
		- continue as desired**

-discussion prompts in advance

-read long text aloud


ethos, im not the expert, im simply a facilitator of learning

questions; raising hand intro
question; commitments agree to
question:

-

provide the grace to grow---instead of assume positive intentions --- im not going to make you grow
creating brave space --- instead of safe space
listening for understanding

### Stage and Street

**NOTABLE QUOTES** 
		
		**purity in the name of virtue is oppressive** \
		
		**power has become invisible** there is no accounting for how much money is made when you see an image

**ANCIENT ATHENS** 

**agora,** a place of performance and theater, no spectators or obvious actors

**Pnyx: ampitheater** spectators AND actors. is set away from the city so that it feels "outside" of the city

**caves** no obvious actors, where the cibels and priestesses lived

you are responsible for your vote 

sitting down was seen as a sign of inferiority or submission, standing up was a position of pride


men who are mostly naked wearing jewelery

liminal space. there, you are seen. but there is a code that prevents people from interacting with you

theives could hold up what they had stolen


liminal space: checking your email while someone next on a plane to you starts a tirade. 

TEATRO OLIMPICO in Vicenza There is a first enclosed theater. Italian? First theater lit at night. Theater becomes a world to itself. ![](http://yourguidetoitaly.com/slowitaly/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/teatro-olimpico.jpg "teatro-olimpico")

Comedie Frances -- A theater that becomes such a world onto itself that what is happening on stage becoms secondary to the drama going on in the boxes.

**Alice Tully Hall:** like any nyc coorporate structure, its easy to see in, but its hard to penetrate. Look but don't touch.

Can be constructed in a matter of a few hours. When the sound was off, he changed the tent. 
A theater should not be a place where people are reflected but a place where they can be exposed to difference.
