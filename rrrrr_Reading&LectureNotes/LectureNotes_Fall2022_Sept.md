**NYC Transit History**

Despite the association of NYC as a city shaped by public transit, the urban form of NYC was actually set by walking. In contrast, Los Angeles was a city shaped by transit that later gave way to highway development.

**1832-1917 The Horse Railway**
	* First line opened 1832
	* 12 Horse Railway by 1860
	* Major Complaints: Congestion + Crowding
	* Had a regulation that mandated a 5 cent fare (nickle fares)

**Beach Pneumatic Railway**
* Alfred Beach. Constructed for mail delivery system. 
* Demonstrated in 1870
* Had a charter in 1873, financial crisis, is abandoned 1874

**Husted Act of 1875**
* Start to see a public interest in planning.  At this point, Route Planning more about approving routes (where busiest). 
* Route planning was more about approving routes that providers wanted to have

Abram Hewitt 1888 call for public investment

William Steinway and the **Rapid Transit Act of 1891**
* Same Steinway as the Pianos 


Two Competing Proposals 1894: 
	**Wilson Proposal,** City loans developer 2/3 of construction costs
	**Hewitt/Chamber of Proposal:** Municipal ownership, private management

**This Era talks:** 
	**Public Sector:** Faciliate urban growth by serving outlying areas. Transit could create sprawl, open up land for development that wasn't walkable. 
	**Private Sector** Goal: Standing Room only train cars in high-density ares. 

1940: Under Fiorello LaGuardia consolidated the three systems into one system.

[[337_WillingnessToPay]]
[[338_Top3UnlikedActivities]]

*Non-ZKN Notes:*
- That travel is a **derived demand** for activity is an axiomatic belief among transportation professions. But the question, would you teleport if given the option challenges this assumption. 

- There is a difference in acceptable times when walking or using a motorized option. People are often wIlling to have a 1-hr motorized commute but not an 1-hr walk. 

- Cyclist: Safety in numbers effect. 

- Trend in cars have become safer for passengers and more dangerous for everyone outside of the car.


| **Value of a Statistical Life** |
|---|---|
|How much more do you have to pay someone to take a riskier job?| Hazard Pay|
|How much are you willing to pay for enhanced safety features like airbags| 


### Facilitation
-   Think about a time when you successfully learned something that was related to a professional role. Which of the features of effective professional learning were in place? How did those features support your learning?

* Modeling (post-it notes)
* Practice Lessons 
* Peer Feedback

*Notes* I had trouble accessing both readings and the Plus/Delta Feedback form due to broken links. 



 facilitation manoevers**

**getting attention;**
- hand raise
- distinctive sounds

**giving directions**
- don't do it just yet

**morale building**
*- exercise with photos and personal stories* #AddToZKN 
	 -timekeeper 2 min per person 
	 -modeling at the start of class and key pointers on the board
	 -collecting photos in advance
	 - trade-offs small group or whole group

**learning commitments 9norms0**
- asking for them in advance---not doing them in the moment
- revisiting them 


**dealing with 'this is a waste of time' issues**
- throw it to the group
- use humor
- give that person a leadership position/talk with them

**universal design for learning** 

**techniques**
-write out a scenario, think for 1 min, turn-and-talk for 5 minutes
- instead of canvas posts, have sent to a teacher. have them weave it into their lectures/presentation. 
 
- Snowball 
		- have individuals review on their own
		- have them discuss in pair
		- have them discuss in group of 4 
		- continue as desired**

-discussion prompts in advance

-read long text aloud


ethos, im not the expert, im simply a facilitator of learning

questions; raising hand intro
question; commitments agree to
question:

-

provide the grace to grow---instead of assume positive intentions --- im not going to make you grow
creating brave space --- instead of safe space
listening for understanding

### Stage and Street

**NOTABLE QUOTES** 
		
		**purity in the name of virtue is oppressive** \
		
		**power has become invisible** there is no accounting for how much money is made when you see an image

**ANCIENT ATHENS** 

**agora,** a place of performance and theater, no spectators or obvious actors

**Pnyx: ampitheater** spectators AND actors. is set away from the city so that it feels "outside" of the city

**caves** no obvious actors, where the cibels and priestesses lived

you are responsible for your vote 

sitting down was seen as a sign of inferiority or submission, standing up was a position of pride


men who are mostly naked wearing jewelery

liminal space. there, you are seen. but there is a code that prevents people from interacting with you

theives could hold up what they had stolen


liminal space: checking your email while someone next on a plane to you starts a tirade. 

TEATRO OLIMPICO in Vicenza There is a first enclosed theater. Italian? First theater lit at night. Theater becomes a world to itself. ![](http://yourguidetoitaly.com/slowitaly/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/teatro-olimpico.jpg "teatro-olimpico")

Comedie Frances -- A theater that becomes such a world onto itself that what is happening on stage becoms secondary to the drama going on in the boxes.

**Alice Tully Hall:** like any nyc coorporate structure, its easy to see in, but its hard to penetrate. Look but don't touch. 

![Alice Tully Hall, Lincoln Center, New York â€“ Diller Scofidio + Renfro ...](https://tse4.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.iqtVQZ6NHM4jvMB6Yo7GZQHaE5&pid=Api)

**Za Koenji Public Theater Toyo Ito**![Za-Koenji Theatre by Toyo Ito, Tokyo, Japan - Architectural Review](https://cdn.ca.emap.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/12/2009/06/AR06_TIA_ZON_003_EDMUND_SUMNER-1024x767.jpg)

Can be constructed in a matter of a few hours. When the sound was off, he changed the tent. 
A theater should not be a place where people are reflected but a place where they can be exposed to difference.
