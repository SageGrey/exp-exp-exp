Bold Statement:
Revise later: 
Not in the thesis. Hands sway, moving a conveyer rope behind the back.

want as little as possible and be as grateful as you can for what you already have 

ask why you are feeling this way and what about you could change? only after that inquire what they can do?

focus on what you could do as a follow . now what the follow could do. 

If it goes away, it wasnt an important enough thought. if it was important, it will come back. thoughts are a anki card loop, not a straight progression of cards falling into the abyss

there are a lot of thesis out there that could have been a zettlkeasten note


This meeting could have been an email. :This thesis could have been a zettlekasten note (note)? 

Our horizons should be short and long.
