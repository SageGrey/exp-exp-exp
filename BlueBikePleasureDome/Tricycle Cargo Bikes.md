Bluebike should introduce Tricycle Cargo Bikes into the bike share fleet.

**Tricycle Cargo Bike Components**
	Make Errands Easier (Or Possible)
	Expand who Feels Comfortable Using A Bike 


**Make Errands Easier**
I don't feel like too much of an explanation is needed to explain why a Cargo Bike makes running errands easier or possible. Routine tasks could become much easier, imagine taking a grocery cart to the Bluebike Station out front of the store and loading the groceries directly in. But it could also expand the agency of bike riders to pickup large items from a hardware store. Places that sell large items (bulk stores, hardware stores, furniture/home accessories stores) could be potential sponsors of this program. 

**Expand Who Can Use Bikes**
A tricycle is a fundamentally more stable tool thank a bike. The pool of people who have bodies that can use tricycles is much larger than those whose bodies allow them to ride a bike. Even if they don't use them to run errands, tricycle cargo bikes could expand the accessibility of the rideshare system.
