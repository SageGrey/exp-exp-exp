Introduce Electric Handbikes into the Bluebike Fleet to expand the pool of who can use the bikeshare system. This would not make Bluebikes accessible to all bodies, but it could eat away at who is excluded. By having these hand bikes lock into the normal docks, you would be pushing the system towards universal design. 

According to the manufacturer, this model of electric hand bike can be connected to 95% of wheelchairs on the market and can be attached and detached with one hand (from a wheelchair).
