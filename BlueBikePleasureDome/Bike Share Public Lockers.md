Public Lockers could provide crucial support to some of the most vulnerable people such as those experiencing homelessness or domestic violence. 

**Considerations:**

**Safety:**
One of the key justifications for removing public lockers and amenities such as luggage checks was the fear that someone would use them as a place to store explosives. This is an important consideration, but it does ignore the fact that we allow public storage to anyone with a car where theoretically the same concern should apply. Safety features such as an attendant, screening procedures, or tracking who is using the locker could mitigate this risk. 

**"Undesired" Users**
One of the other key justifications for removing public lockers was that they were being used by large numbers of people experiencing homelessness. The cruelty of this being used as a justification to remove them should be readily apparent. But unfortunately, it will be a consideration given the sustained community pushback against any service that could lead to folks experiencing homelessness to congregate. However, one striking advantage that public lockers offer is the ability for folks experiencing homeless to use lockers to distance themselves from one of the key indicators used to identify homeless individuals--carrying around a cumbersome number of bags.
