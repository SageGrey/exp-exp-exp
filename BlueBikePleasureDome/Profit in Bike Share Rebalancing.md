Increase compensation for the Bluebike Angels rewards program such that rebalancing bikes becomes a worthwhile endeavor. Depending on how high the rewards are set this could create either a situation where rebalancing bikes is seen as a fun way to get exercise with some perks to making "riding for Bluebikes" competitive with job prospects such as "driving for Uber."

For this program, Bluebike could partner with local businesses to "match" rewards. Using a similar model to credit card rewards programs, Bluebike riders could increase the compensation by choosing to "cash out" their points with a participating local business. So for example, instead of cashing out $1.00 of Bluebike rewards, they could cash out $5.00 at Tags Hardware or Momo's and Curry and Bluebikes would pay that business $1.
