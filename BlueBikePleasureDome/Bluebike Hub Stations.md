**Description** 
Create an analogue to Gas Stations that serve the needs of cyclists, pedestrians and active transit users. This can be done by either altering existing gas stations by taking over some of the pumps/retail space, taking over an entire gas station and removing the pumps, or building a new space in an empty lot. 

**Bike Hub Station Components**
	* Bluebike Valet Service
	* Convenience Store
	* Public Restrooms + Showers
	* Bike Service Station
	* Access to climate controlled environment
	* Public Lockers
	* Ease Rebalancing Efforts in Local Area

**Bluebike Valet Service**
One way that bike share has learned to deal with high capacity is by rolling out "valet service" where a staff member is positioned at a station during peak times. When lots of riders are coming to a station, their role is to remove bikes from the docks as they fill up. They they then lock these surplus bikes together.  When lots of riders are leaving a station, the valet's job is to unlock bikes or unroll them from a van that is parked nearby. 

With a Bluebike Hub Station, you could have a constant valet service. In contrast to the current model where Valet is only available at certain stations at peak demand hors, staff at the Bluebike Hub Station convenience store could double as Bluebike Valet attendants. At peak times, they would likely to need to be outside collecting bikes, but when the station is busy but not hectic, they could simply "keep an eye" on the available docks. 

Bluebike valet workers could also have dedicated space where they could make a "corral" for bikes. This could save time by reducing the need to weave a lock through each individual bike each time a new bike arrives.

**Convenience Store**
At the convenience store attached to most gas stations, you would have the opportunity to sell the usual fare (snacks, drinks, phone chargers, sunglasses, and hot coffee) but it would also be able to cater to needs that are unique to active transport such as:
* Clothing
	* Hats/Gloves/Scarves
	* Sunglasses
	* Rain Ponchos
* Safety Gear
	* Bike Lights/Fresh Batteries
	* Helmets
	* First Aid Supplies 
* Bike Parts
	* Flat Tire Repair Kits
	* Grip Tape

**Public Restrooms + Showers** 
In the same way that Gas Stations provide restrooms to drivers and showers to truck drivers, Bluebike Hub Stations could provide a way for folks without cars to easily take a bathroom break or clean up.  This would also have huge advantages for other populations, including folks experiencing homelessness, that could benefit from public bathrooms/showers. 

**Bike Service Station**
The Hub Stations could include not only a bike service station, but also employees who are trained on how to help inexperienced bicyclists with needs like fixing a tire or adjusting a bike seat. 

**Access to Climate Controlled Space**
The Hub Station would act as a place where all sorts of transit riders could come and warm up or cool down. As we enter more extreme climate realities, this could help make active transport methods an attractive option. 

**Public Lockers** 
One of the major advantages that driving a car brings is the ability to securely lock up possessions while one goes about their day. This used to be accomplished in American cities through the availability of public lockers, but in the late 80s and early 90s, due to bias against people experiencing homelessness and security concerns, lockers were removed. Hub Stations could provide affordable public lockers in a way that addresses security concerns. 

**Ease Rebalancing Efforts in Local Area**
If there is a nearby location that has a surplus of bikes and functionally unlimited capacity to store bikes, the logistics needed to rebalance bikes within a couple mile radius would be simplified. More rebalancing could be done with small bike trailers (such as currently done in Portland).
