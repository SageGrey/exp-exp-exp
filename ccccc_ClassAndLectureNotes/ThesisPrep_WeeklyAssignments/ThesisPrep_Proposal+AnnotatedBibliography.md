### **Research/Design Question**:
	What are ways that Greater Boston could incorporate more opportunities for pleasure within it's public transportation system? 

### **Why this merits study**

There are two principal reasons why I want to look at public transportation through the lens of pleasure. 

**Reason 1: Closing the Pleasure Gap as a means of shifting riders to public transit:** 
The City of Boston, like other metro regions in the United States, has publicly announced its intention to shift transportation away from cars towards public transit and non-motorized options such as walking and biking. Go Boston 2030, the city's comprehensive plan published in 2017, is filled with goals such as hit a fourfold increase in bicycle riders, increase transit use by 33%, and reach carbon neutrality by 2050. To successfully realize these goals and coax more people out of their cars, Boston will need to improve public transportation options so that they are competitive with cars when considering reliability, cost, and speed. But while reliability, cost, and speed are crucial, I want to use this thesis to argue that they are not the only improvements worth investing in. 
If we see cars exclusively as a tool to get from A to B, we miss key information about the differences between private vehicles and public transit. Cars do a lot more than simply transport. For some, cars are a way to broadcast identity, for others cars are a way that they can arrive to a place feeling put-together, for others they are a tactical command-center that can hold supplies for a complex day. One way these additional facets of driving are connected is that they contribute to pleasure, either by making the journey more pleasant, or by allowing their users to engage in pleasurable activities throughout the city. Whether or not they are ultimately successful at this goal, Cars are sold with a promise of pleasure. When we think about  inequity between car riders and transit riders, we should be thinking about more than just time in transit. Making adjustments that center pleasure in public transit obviously alone cannot solve decades of disinvestment, but as we think about ways to work towards transportation justice and decrease car use, I think looking for opportunities to center and explore pleasure is fertile ground.

** Reason 2: Centering Pleasure as Reparative Planning**
It's hard to fathom the sheer magnitude of harm caused by transportation planning's past in Boston and around the country. Decisions made in past eras, like the destruction of Black neighborhoods so that white suburban residents could drive on highways, still shape and harm communities across the country. But like other aching injustices, the path to righting past wrongs and fighting for transit justice remains a dispiriting and painful process . A reason to think about transportation through the lens of pleasure is that it makes room for analysis and community visioning that is allowed to dwell on something beyond the problems. In this project I want to look to precedent such as abolitionist activists Adrienne Maree Brown and Robin D. G. Kelley, asset-based planning, and the work of the grassroot activist organization ACT-LA. I'm interested in looking at pleasure and public transportation as an expansive way to think about public transit in a way that examines the experience of riders on public transit and proposes ways to address their needs. The MBTA is facing hard days with a system facing the consequence of long-overdue repairs. Right now the system can not afford the investments that it would need to meaningfully improve routes across the city. But could paying attention to ways that the system could be more mindful of pleasure help absorb the shock of a flailing system? 


*Without new visions, we don’t know what to build, only what to knock down. We not only end up confused, rudderless, and cynical, but we forget that making a revolution is not a series of clever maneuvers and tactics but a process that can and must transform us. (Kelley, 2022)*

### **Where this Sits in the Literature**

HI! Heads up that this section is especially DRAFTY. I've been focused more on trying to get through material than pulling it all together. Will work on transitions/cohesion soon. 


** Happiness in Cities/Urban Design** 

 Charles Montgomery's book the Happy City is a book that writes to a non-planning audience about ways that urban design can center happiness. His analysis looks at the consequences of what he describes as the "dispersed city," the way that city planning became focused on sprawling typographies and the social, economic, and environmental cost of this decision. Montgomery's book looks at efforts globally to center happiness in Urban Planning, such as Bogota's development under leadership of Enrique Peñalosa or NYC under Janette Sadik-Khan. Montgomery makes the argument in his book that the environmental city and the happy city are the same place.   

Not Just Bikes is a wildly popular youtube channel that looks at urban planning, especially transportation planning, and documents best practices from countries across Europe, in particular the Netherlands. The channel also spends many of the videos critiquing American planning such as sprawl, Stroads, and out-of-control highway development.  

**Abolitionist Planning + Freedom Dreams**
This work is grounded in an appreciation for visionaries such as Audre Lorde, Bell Hooks, Grace Lee Boggs, Octavia Butler, Robin DG Kelley, and Adrienne Maree Brown who argue that in the face of crippling injustice, we can and must employ our imagination, and turn towards hope and pleasure and joy as a way forward.   Robin D. G. Kelley's freedom dreams and Adrienne Maree Brown's articulation of pleasure activism are especially central to my current thinking. This project is in essence an attempt to cultivate what Kelley calls, 'New Visions'[^1] and answers Adrienne Maree Brown's provocation, "How would we organize and move our communities if we shifted to focus on what we long for and love rather than what we are reacting to?" [^2]

**Pleasure as part of Just Transition** 
The Just Transition framework (shown below) is described by Climate Justice Alliance as "a vision-led, unifying and place-based set of principles, processes and practices that build economic and political power to shift from an extractive economy to a regenerative economy."[^3] The framework is a synthesis of ideology that traces its roots to labor unions and environmental justice groups. 

The framework articulates the strategy needed to shift from an extractive economy to what is described as a living economy. The extractive economy, the current status quo, is a paradigm where resources are recklessly extracted, consumed and discarded, labor is exploited, and wealth and power is denied to all but a small minority. This extractive economy is supported by state violence and a worldview that embraces growth, consumption, and colonial extraction.  The living economy in contrast is one where resources are collected in a sustainable and regenerative fashion with non-extractive labor practices based on cooperation. Instead of enriching a small minority, the benefits of this economy are distributed. The system is not governed by imperial powers and violence but through a system where decision making is brought back to the smallest relevant scale and individuals are in control of decisions that impact their lives. This system is guided by a worldview that centers caring and treating life and environments as sacred. 

The overall strategy for this transition is to "starve and stop" the extractive economy and "feed and grow" the living economy. 

The following are six components denoted as part of this transition. 
* Reallocate economic resources and power away from international forces towards community control. 
* Create more in income distribution and workplaces (Democratize the Workplace )
* Push for more ecological restoration of degraded environments
* Work towards racial justice and social equity
* Create systems of production and consumption that keep the system local
* Support and restore cultural traditions and knowledge

The most obvious way that centering pleasure in our transportation networks intersects with Just Transition principles is how it aligns with the world view that the living economy requires. The just transition seeks to move a culture obsessed with growth and consumption into a culture that centers care and sustainability. 

If we strive to embed care into public transportation, we are in essence striving to care for the people who use it. We are not focusing on incorporating pleasure only because it will get workers to work faster, increase the amount consumers would spend, or that it would reduce the amount of spending on social services. Instead we would do it as a way to respect and care for those using the system. Its possible that embedding pleasure could have positive repercussions, such as buoyed mood, reduced mental strain, social interaction---but these factors would likely do little to further the consolidation of wealth and power and would instead contribute to what the just transition describes as 'Ecological and Social Well-being'

### **Approach**
The broad outline of my project approach is that I want to first look for precedent about efforts to center pleasure in urban planning in transportation systems throughout the US and Internationally. Then will pitch designs that are specific to Boston's transportation system. 

Chapter 1: Exploring Pleasure and Movement
	In the introduction chapter, I want to build up a matrix that 1. identifies different components and conditions of pleasure relevant to transportation and 2. identifies examples of ideas to incorporate that component of pleasure into transit networks. I have not started formatting this into a matrix, but as I do research, I am building up a map that will eventually become the basis for this matrix. 
	
	![[Pasted image 20221111082046.png]]
In the next three chapters I want to take a deep dive into three of the components/realms of pleasure that were identified in the first chapter.

* Chapter 2: What to do with stuff
	* In this chapter I want to look at ways that the pleasure gap could be closed regarding schlepping.  I want to look at
		* History around the development and closure of public lockers and luggage checks at stations
		* Needs of public lockers in unhoused communities 
		* Design Idea: Bringing back public lockers in a way that addresses security concerns and serves needs of housed and unhoused users
		* Design Idea: Incorporating Cargo Bikes into Bluebike System
		* Design Idea: Hooks in transit vehicles

* Chapter 3: Feeling Welcomed
	* Looks at the ratio of policing to care in transit networks
	* Looks at community policing on transit
