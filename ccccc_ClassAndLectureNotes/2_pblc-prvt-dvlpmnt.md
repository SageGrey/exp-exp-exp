  **Kaydens Summary Predictions**  
  
       1. Public Private partnerships are here to stay. Inequality is on the rise. The urban project beguiles. ESG (environmental, social, governance) Metrics increasingly important.  
       2. All real estate is public private development  
       3. Public private deals are increasingly complicated and costly  
       4. Public entreprenesurship is a new profession that is rising. 
       5. Scholars and practitioners need to dive deeper  
       6. There are new institutional powers (Eds and Meds)  
       7. Private provision of public benefits will continue
       8. Climate change will fundamentally change how we live. 
       9. Changing live-work arrangements will lead to poly-centric cicties. 
       10. Skepticism about public-private development will continue
  
  
  **REMINDER** Write down assumptions. 
  
 Social Value: Difference between COST TO PRIVDE and VALUE. VALUE is not the discount.

## Views From Above
 <details>
  <Summary> Kaydens Candid Caveats </Summary>
  
     1. Refa skills dont guarantee a succesful real estate career. Personality counts  
     2. Garbage (Data) In, Garbage Out  
     3. Play the Long Game, Don't Burn Bridges   
        (At the end of negotiations, try to leave with everyone feeling good)  
     4. Be(A)ware  the tower of babel. Ask names of terms, many things have many synonyms.

    <summary> One Hand Clapping </summary>

### Private Sector Alone 
(ie if public makes the private sector do it all)
  * Money will go elsewhere _dont kill the golden goose_
  * Is it Legal? _constitutional rights limits what can be demanded of private_
  * Political feasability
  * Private sector might not contorl the land
    
### Public Sector Alone
  * Public may lack the skills/capacity
  * lack the land
  * lack the money
  
### JOINT VENTURES MODEL
  The idea that both public and private are better off working together
  
#### Both Can Provide/Get
  * $ Money
  * Land
  * Infrastructure
  
#### Private can offer
  * Skills/expertise (entrepreneurship)
  * Freedom from government relations
  
#### Public can offer
  * Eminent Domain
  * Freedom from markets
  * Political clout

  <Summary> Can Opener Joke </summary>
    
 ### Assume we have a can opener joke
 
                       A popular economics joke has a physicist, a chemist, and an economist all stranded on a desert island. 
                       There is one can of food, but nothing to open it with. 
                       The physicist presents his proposed solution (usually hitting the can with a rock). 
                       The chemist presents his proposed solution (such as heating a seawater solution with the sun’s rays). 
                       The economist comes up with the simple, unrealistic solution: “Assume we have a can opener...” 
                       One variant is: “Assume the can is open...”
                       
                       Source: The desert island “assume we have a can opener” joke dates to at least 1970 and possibly originated with British economists.

  ##  Real Estate Financial Analysis (REFA) Methods: Pro Forma
**Necessary, sufficient, but not excessive.** The goal is to analyse how much Gov should provide, how much private should provide. What is the Gap between desired and market return.

**NOTES** 
  * There is a difference between Square Footage AND Net Rentable Square Footage.  
  * Percentage Rents (Some Retail pays a PERCENTAGE of sales instead of fixed rent  
  * "Face Rent" vs "Effective Rent" (If Landlord gives a deal such as 1-month free)
  
   
#### Additional Income
Vending, Laundry, Concierge, Etc.

 * The unrented square feet owing to time taken to rent
 * RENT UP PERIOD 
     example: if it takes 1/2 year to find a tenant every 12 years. 
     .5/12.5 --> 4% vacancy
     
 * Vacancy calculations depend on getting numbers from market conditions (Strong or Weak)

    A ROOKIE MISTAKE:
    Someone saying they will do it themselves so dont put in cost.   
    problem 1 --> what happens if they get sick  
    problem 2 --> opportunity cost of their labor

     THIS IS THE PROPERTY TAX, DONT CONFUSE IT WITH OTHER TAXES
     Properties generally assessed by gov every 1-3 years
     Commercial rates tend to be higher. This is frequently explained by the Home Voter Hypothesis (commercial properties dont vote).

  </details>

 ### Debt Service 
  
  <details> 
    <summary> (Debt Services) </summary> 
    
         
[**Debt Service (Interest + Amortization)** ](https://github.com/SageGrey/exp-exp-exp/blob/main/zzzzz_cards/205_DebtService.md)
    
**Debt Service = (Interest + Amortization)**

Debt Service is the payment on debt owned, sometimes called the **Financing Payment**. The part of Debt Service that goes towards interest is **tax deductable**, the part going to amortization is not. As time passes, the amount of debt service that is going towards paying off the principle _(amortization)_ increases, so the taxable portion will also increase.  
    
Generally people want to borrow as much as possible due to "Positive Financial Leverage" (able to make more money off of your money than the interest on debt costs)
     Two Components of Debt Service
     1. DEBT --> How much debt
     2. EQUITY --> Amount Dev/Investory used to begin with 
    
![amortization and interest rate](https://github.com/SageGrey/exp-exp-exp/blob/main/ooooo_mixedMedia/i4_amortization_schedule_30year_fixed.gif)

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34726888/166566803-4a99e096-319c-4d52-ad35-131735a95973.png)

**To calculate amortization for a fixed-rate mortgage -->**  
**Constant Mortgage Payment - Interest Payment = Amortization **  
 1. First calculate interest payment (Outstanding Loan x Interest Rate)   
 2. Take the fixed loan payment  
 3. Subtract these values  
    
  </details>    

 ### CFAF 
  
  <details>
    <summary> CFAF: Cash Flow After Financing </summary>
    
    Income Remaining one the debt has been serviced. Income that is distributed to investors and limited partners who then have to pay INCOME taxes on it. 
  
    CFAF = NOI - Debt Service  
    ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34726888/166571238-6e51b925-67a9-4b1f-a05b-bc4c5059d53c.png)

###  Tax Payment = Taxable Income x Tax RateTax Payment. 
Happens in **3 Steps**. Tax Income DOES NOT EQUAL the Tax Payment, Do this calculation in a seperate place so you don't accidentally swap them.   
  
    <details> 
      <summary> Allowable Deductions Overview </summary> 
      
      Allowable Income **Tax Deductions** from taxable income 
          You can DEDUCT your EXPENSES from your income
          --> Mortgage loan interest (just the interest part, not the amortization)
          --> Operating Expenses
          --> Real Estate Taxes
          --> Depreciation of Property 
               --> To account for the theoretical deterioration of the property
               --> Basically a built-in subsidy              
         
         You CANNNOT DEDUCT 
          --> Amortization (This would amount to paying money to yourself, not an expense)
          --> Replacement Reserve not Deductable
    
    </details>
    
    <details> 
      <summary> Step One: Calculate Amortization </summary>

    Amortization = Debt Service - Interest

**Return Measures (Rates of Returns)**
      
     Asset Value x Rate of Return = Income
     
     Rate of Return = Income / Asset Value
     
### Return on Total Assets 

     --> Measure of profitability based on total asset cost (or value)
     --> Same as income returned, or "Free and Clear" 
     
     ROTA = NOI/Total Development Cost
     _Return on Equity_ -->
    
### Return on Equity

    --> Incone returned on equity invested
    -->Also known as "Cash on Cash"
    --> If ROE is greater than ROTA you have positive leverage
    ROE = Cash Flow After Taxes/Equity Invested
    
### Cap (Capitalization) Rates
    
    Market derived rates (percentages) based on market data of ratio of recently sold property NOIs and dales prices 
    Cap Rate = NOIs/Sales Price
    
    Higher the cap rate, the lower the value
    (Lower cap rate, higher value)
    
    Capitalized Value = NOI/ Cap Rate

     2. Permanent Loan
     
     Conventional Mortgage Loan
     -> Mortgage vs Mortgage Loan 
     --> MOST PEOPLE THINK OF MORTGAGE AS: Type of Loan that uses real estate as collateral
     --> Mortgage is actually a LIEN
         Lien--> legal claim held by the lender on the property of the borrower
         Mortgage provides security for the lender.
         Loan is _secured_ by the mortgage
         
         
     --> Loan to Value Ratios
     Common today for Developer to recieve loans for 60% of costs to build
     
     --> Conventional Fixed-Rate Mortgage Loan
          -->Interest amount is fixed
          --> Amount paid to lender does not vary (30 year loan)
          --> You are paying "Debt Service" 
          
          --> Debt Service = Interest + Amortization 
            AmortizLoan Amount * Loan Constant
          --> Amortization = "Repayment of Mortgage Loan itself (Principle)
          --> Principle (The origianl amount that was loaned)  
          
          --> Look at a Constant Chart/Schedule 
               --> Rows (Interest Rate)

  <Summary> Various Types of Financial Analysis </summary>
  
### Cost Benefit Analysis: Is it worth doing?
   
      Not super common in public private development  
      CBA seeks to measure in MONETARY TERMS net increase/decrease in goods/services taken by project for society as a whole. 
      
      PROBLEMS WITH CBA:
      --> Does not account for WHO is benefited, WHO is harmed
      --> Monetizing benefits is hard
      --> Future benefits have discount rates applied (higher discount rate, lower benefits valued) 
      --> Calculating costs is MUCH easier than calculating benefits

**Modified CBA for Public-Private Development**   
  Looks at the DISTRIBUTION of benefits.  
  Doesn't monetize everything  
  
### Cost-Effectiveness Analysis: What is the Cheapest Way
 
      Assumes the project is happening. But we would like it to be as cheap as possible
      Neccesary, Sufficient, But not excessive
      
### Economic Benefit Analysis
   More or Less a PR tool.

     Also known as "regional income analysis."
     Contributuions to an economy in a specific area. 
     Uses multipliers, for every $X, there is # benefits. 
     
     Looks at: 
     Direct Spending -- How much did it cost
     Indirect Spending -- How much businesses (tenantS) spend
     Induced Spending -- How much people that have jobs as a consequence of this project will spend
     
     Problems with this kind of analysis:
     Boosterism
     Substitution Effect (This project might take away from that other project)
     Models can be faulty
     Local Economy Leakage --> Is it actually going locally?

### Fiscal Impact Analysis

Useful for fully private projects.  Looks at how much will a new project affect government **revenue (tax base increases)** and **costs (needed municiple services).**

  <Summary> Who Has Power in Cities? </Summary>
**Real Politik** Day to day operations, Tussling in the Maelestrom
 **See ZKN note:** 
  [232_7TheoriesofPower](https://github.com/SageGrey/exp-exp-exp/blob/main/zzzzz_cards/232_7TheoriesofPower.md)
    
Elite Reputational:
This theory is based off of observations of Atlanta. The central tenant is that repuatation is essentially equal to power. So cultivating status is thus cultivating power. Who do you think is the most important person to consult is the top businessman or power broker.

Elite Structural Theory:
This theory is a more Marxist approach that argues that structural features od society (capitalism) are the determinants of who has power. This is associated with the power coming from the institutions that have societal reproduction.

Pluralist
This theory is based on observations of New Haven. Is arguing against the elite reputational theories saying that there is actually a broad base of folks who influence the city that are widely disperesed. Argues that the power of elites is exaggerated.

Historical Institutional
Essentially is an argument for path dependency. What has happened heavily shapes what will.

Public Choice Theory
This theory essentially applies neo-classical economic theory to government actors. Argues that all actors in governemnt are ultimately making choices based on their self-interest, not neccesarily the public good. definitely this meshes well with Rick Ulibarri's beliefs about politics. How is James Buchanon is associated with this idea?

Growth Machine Theory
Given that many industries are benefited by growth (developers, lawyers, ad firms, architects, etc) there is a wide-based push from corporate forces to see things built. Example is why media companies love the construction of sports stadiums.

Regime Theory
This idea comes from Clarance Stone writing about Atlanta. It is similar to Growth Machine Theory, but it combines the interests of both private and public figures, what could be called "the elites."

  <summary> 2 Administrative Models: Discretionary + As Of Right </summary>
  
  .   
 ### As of Right: _ministerial model_   
 The model where the zoning allows for development that meets pre-determined specifications. The role of the city is to evaluate a project based on these specifications. If it meets them, it is approved. 
   * Is often used in cooler markets that are trying to encourage development
   * Can be more transparent
  
 ### Discretionary
 The model where projects are approved on a case-by-case basis. The role of the city is to negotiate benefits from any project that is proposed.
   * Often used in hot markets (NYC, SF, Vancouver)
   * Can be a way for groups (such as Labor) to seek out promises

### Historic Timeline of Public Subsidies

This is a history focusing on money, provided by gov. to other sectors for "government desired" projects in order to lower the overall cost. 

**Fiscal Federalism-->** From wikipedia
As a subfield of public economics, fiscal federalism is concerned with "understanding which functions and instruments are best centralized and which are best placed in the sphere of decentralized levels of government" (Oates, 1999)...

### 1929 - 39 : 
  Great Depression
### 1933 Public Works Administration
Was intended to create more jobs, the logic was to create a multiplier effect for public spending. Established *Slum Clerance Housing* only 29,000 units that were modeled off of european housing models
### 1934 FHA is established
Also created the program of federal housing insurance loans. Even the CREATION of this program was influential, inspiring confidence even with banks not using these loans. `can you say more about this point, how were they influential even were they not using these loans?`
### [Housing Act of 1937](https://github.com/SageGrey/exp-exp-exp/blob/main/zzzzz_cards/ThirtyPercentThreshold_HousingAct1937.md)
Creates pubic housing that is state owned, where ownership/operation is run by gov. 
Was conditioned on a 1:1 basis, so it did not really increase the quanitity of public housing. 
This act establishes the 30% rent burden threshold
### [Post WWII, Housing Act of 1949](https://github.com/SageGrey/exp-exp-exp/blob/main/zzzzz_cards/Disinvestment_HousingAct1949.md)
Sets goal for every family having a home. Embraces the public-private model (this is in large part from a need to not seem socialist)

**Title 1** of this act authorized "Slum Clearance," It also introduced the idea of urban renewal, but did not use those terms, instead described bligheted land and slums.
Established the **Land Write-down model** that gov would buy blighted land and then sell at below cost (or $1) to private actors. 

**Title 2** Mortgage loan insurance for **new** construction (disinvestment in the cities, and building suburbia)

### 1965 Creating of HUD
_Urban legend of wanting it to be called Dept of Urban Development, but acronym would be DUD_

    This is a shoft from numberous categorical funding sources to consolidated Block Grants. In this time period, 129 Categorical Grants were consolidated into 6 Block Grants

For example: Community Development Block Grant

CDBG is based on a formula (4/5ths) and discretionary (1/5) The original formula considered poverty ratio, population, available housing. Was ammended to inclue pre 1940s housing.

**Credits** the amount is subtracted from the tax bill, can be sold
**Deductions** the amount is subtracted from taxable income around tax time

Examples: $1,000 Credit/Deduction for someone at 15% tax bracket

  <summary> Land Acquisition </summary>
 
 **IN US: General land ownership breakdown**   
 60% private    
 40% gov     
 2% tribal  
 
 **A few reasons why gov might buy land**
 Government might want to aquire land in order to reap the economic benefit of the infrastructure that it has invested in.   
 Government can buy land in order to create false scarcity to increase value. Can soemtimes be called **Land Banking**  
 Land acquisition as form of punishment (refusal to pay property taxes (tax forclosure), take compensation for illicit drugs, etc.)  
 For corrupt reasons!

  <summary> Land Aquisition Controversies: Kelo Case Details </summary>

 ### Case Overview: Kelo vs City of New London, 2005
 Court Case where Pfizer wanted to move in, city wanted to develop a research campus. Create jobs, tax revenue, development (common development plan). They would need to acquire 115 land parcels. They would lease to private developer for 1$ a year for 99 years. (The 1$ is for "consideration" in order to have a valid contract, not just a gift). Suzette Kelo didn't want to sell. Used eminent domain, went all the way to the supreme court. The Court **UPHELD** the use of eminent domain by slim minority (5-4).

  </details> 
 
 Big Issue with Kelo: Is this a **"Public Use""** (the court said yes, public purpose is public use).   
 
**The Basic Controversy**: Taking Private Use "A" and moving it to private use "B." Governemnt declaring that B is more valuable than A. Dissent argued that this would mean that "any lower use of land could be subject to being flipped."  
_Other Noteworthy Elements_: Eminent domain as applied to "unblighted" land, (ie the plaintiff wasn't poor).   
  
**Consequence of Kelo**: More than 40 State legislators tightened eminent domain, clarified that eminent domain could only be used for blight, and redefined what blight is. Thus cementing the legacy that eminent domain can only be used again low-income folks. 

**"Fair Market Compensation"**: What a willing buyer would pay a willing seller. This becomes a fiction if the seller isn't willing to sell.

   <summary> Land Re-Adjustment </summary> 
   
 Land Re-Adjustment: 
  Used when there are areas of fragmented, oddly configured development. This type of endeavor is particularly useful for the development of infrastructure. 
  
  Offers promised of something _less Coercive_ than Eminent Domain. All land is pooled, redistributed. Then land is given back to members of the pool. Will get somewhat less land back. Residents will be willing since the land will be higher value.

Pattern: Depends based on country/place, but basic pattern
     * Step 1: Local gov create an entity that will stage the project. The entity will then seek support from involved owners. Generally 50% + 1 of owners have to agree to pool their parcels. They then buy parcels 
     * Step 2: Create a plan. Set aside land for infrastructure, re-sale (to produce revenue for the project). 
     * Step 3: Original land is returned to owners, but in smaller amounts. 

_What about the minority that doesn't want to sell?_ They are forced to sell by the entity at an amount that does not exceed the land value of their neighbors. This is of course reminiscent of eminent domain. 
   
  </details>
  
  <details> 
  <summary> What rights should the neighbors have? </summary>
  
  Neighbors frequently assume that they have legal rights that they do not actually posess.  
  Neighbors do bear burden to increased development.

  <summary> Community Benefit Agreement </summary>
  
  #### CBAs are a legally enforcable contract between a developer and a community group that specifies benefits that the developer will provide in return from either support or at least lack of opposition from a community group.   Used very infrequently. 
  
  
  #### Advantages for Developer
  * Might end up needing to provide fewer benefits than if you went through a political process
  * Guaranteed political support (or at least less opposition)
  
  #### Advantages for Community
  * Can negotiate directly w/o government as intermediary
  * Can negotiate benefits for THAT community, not the region more broadly
  * Community can sue the developer for failing to provide benefits w.o the city
  
  #### Challenges for Public
  * Memory of what was in the CBA can fade
  * Community does not always represent a broad swath of the public

 <details> 
  <summary> Business Improvemnt Districts BID </summary>
  
  #### Legaglly defined geographic area in which special fees are sought for projects in the area. 
  Funds can go to   
  Infrastructure Projects: Sidwalks, Transit 
  Services: Sanitation Services, Safety 
  
 #### Why do it?
  * Distribute Costs
  * Combat the freerider problem
  * Government owns the property
  
 #### How?
 A governing body (such as national, state) authorizes local government to make BIDs. Local gov approaches stakeholders. if 50% + 1 say yes, it can be created and apply to everyone. (Similar to land re-adjustment).
  
  #### Considerations + Challenges
  * BID boards tend to be undemocratic, represent bussiness and landowner interest
  * Can lead to heavy policing (ie the GOON SQUAD in NYC around Grand Central Station)  
  * BID can avoid some of the rules of government
  * Useful for a neighborhood to have a champion

  <Summary> Tax-Increment Financing </summary>
    
      **Tax-Increment Financing:** Up until that point, all property tax went to the general budget of the city. NOW, any increase in property value now is earmarked to provide money for infrastructure improvements in the district. So property tax APPRECIATION will go to infrastructure improvements. This might make the value go up, thus creating a virtuous circle.

STEP TWO: Goc announces RFP  
STEP THREE: Engages with potential participants   
STEP FOUR: Gov reviews development proposal and _TENTATIVELY_ determine a winner  
STEP FIVE: Gov negotiates with the tentative winner, enters into a binding winner   

          Minor modifications permitted, major modifications are deeply problematic
          AND can result in lawsuits.

Implementation Techniques 

Public Subsidies 

Key ideas: “but for” test; necessary, sufficient but not excessive; rule-based vs. discretionary-based 

Grants 

Categorical grant: federal grants given to state and local governments to encourage their cooperation in implementing specific purposes and programs. 

These grants give less flexibility to state governments than block grants. 

Federal officials place significant restrictions on states that accept grants and are quite specific about how funds are to be spent in specific policy “categories.” 

Block grant: federal grants-in-aid that allow states considerable discretion (within broad limits) about how the funds will be spent. 

These give greater flexibility to state political actors to tailor programs to the state’s particular needs than do categorical grants. 

The federal government places few restrictions, allowing states to spend funds within broad programmatic areas. 

E.g. Community Development Block Grant – from the DHUD website, “the CDBG program provides annual grants on a formula basis to states, cities, and counties to develop viable urban communities by providing decent housing and a suitable living environment, and by expanding economic opportunities, principally for low- and moderate-income persons. 

Loans 

Loan insurance: the government can cover debt payments on certain loans if the insured loses their ability to pay due to a covered event 

Loan guarantees: the government can protect a percentage of the business owners’ personal assets if they default on a loan 

Bonds: financial instrument through which the bond issuer borrows money from the government and agrees to pay back periodic interest plus repay the full principal at the end of the bond term 

General Obligation Bonds: are issued by municipalities and secured by the full faith and credit of the issuer 

Special Obligation/Revenue Bonds: are secured by a dedicated revenue source such as a toll road, hospital, higher-education system, etc.

Tax Incentives 

Deductions: are subtracted from a taxpayer’s otherwise taxable income to compute the tax base; reduce tax liability by the amount of the tax deduction times the tax rate. E.g. A $1k deduction in a 15% tax bracket reduces taxable income by $1k, thereby reducing tax liability by $150. 

Tax abatements (e.g. $20k of a tax bill waived) 

Tax exemptions (not-for-profit/religious institution status) 

Credits: reduce tax liability dollar-for-dollar 

E.g. LIHTC, New Market Tax Credits 

Public Land Disposition 

RFPs 

Five stages of an RFP 

Government prepares RFP (or RFQ) document à government announces RFP à government engages with potential participants through FAQs, conferences, meetings à government reviews development proposals and tentatively designates a winner à government negotiates with the winner and enters an agreement 

Auctions: after a prequalification process, the project is given to the highest responsible bidder – can be an open outcry or sealed bid auction 

Sole Source: working with a single provider throughout 

Public Land Acquisition 

Eminent Domain: refers to the power of government to take private property and convert it into public use. The Fifth Amendment provides that the government may only exercise this power if they provide just compensation to the property owner. 

In Kelo v. City of New London, the Supreme Court held that general benefits which a community would enjoy from the furthering of economic development are sufficient to qualify as a “public use.” 

The technique of last resort. 

Provision of Physical Infrastructure 

Capital Budgets: a budget allocating money for the acquisition or maintenance of fixed assets such as land, buildings, and equipment. 

Public-Private Partnerships: Long-term contracts between a private party and a government entity, for providing a public asset or service, in which the private party bears significant risk and management responsibility.  

PPPs encompass many forms of public-private collaboration, including operation and maintenance contracts; leases; concessions; build, operate, transfer (BOT); build own, operate, and transfer (BOOT).  

The local government must have the authorization of upper-level government to do so and there should be a regulatory framework for contract enforcement and disagreement resolution.  

The project must offer a good risk-adjusted return that is attractive to the private sector. This may involve good cash flow based on revenue (paid by users) or service fees (paid by authority). 

Exactions: something the local zoning authority requires a property owner to give to the community, in order to obtain approval to develop land. The “something” can be almost anything: land; a portion of the value of the land; money (a mitigation fee); or other property.  

Rough proportionality 

Essential nexus 

Land Readjustment 

Landowners will pool their smaller parcels into one large parcel and then have those readjusted. The land is pooled into a readjustment scheme, then given back to the original owners. They don’t get all their lands back. They might get the same land back, or not. But the land is of higher value per acre because it is now serviced land. 

Valorization 

Tax Increment Financing: a value capture revenue tool that uses taxes on future gains in real estate values to pay for new infrastructure improvements. 

 

Private Provision of Public Benefits 

Exactions 

Inclusionary Zoning 

Linkage 

Incentive Zoning 

Planning Gain 

Development Approval Process (including affirmatively furthering fair housing mandates) 

Community Benefits Agreements 

Business Improvement Districts 

Conservancies 

Friends Organizations

I. COURSE DESCRIPTION 
 
 A complex blend of private and public actions develops the buildings, physical 
infrastructure, and public spaces that constitute urban areas. Why do private actors originate 
some activities while public actors originate others? Are there universal rationales and practices 
governing such allocations? When and how should government offer incentives to private 
developers, if ever, to encourage private provision of public benefits? To what extent may 
private developers be required to provide public benefits? Are public-private partnerships a 
solution or a problem? How illuminating, finally, are the labels “public” and “private” for 
understanding and advancing the creation of productive, equitable, sustainable, and attractive 
cities? 
 
 In the United States, the map of public and private responsibilities for urban development 
has shifted from sharp to flexible, even porous, boundaries. Starting mid-twentieth-century and 
accelerating to the present, arrangements for conceptualizing, financing, and managing urban 
development have flowed back and forth. Depending on the context, governments provide 
financial subsidies, land, physical infrastructure, and enhanced development rights, or require 
developers, as a condition of development approval, to provide physical infrastructure, 
affordable housing, public space, and other public benefits. Developers routinely consult  
citizens groups at increasingly earlier stages of project development, seeking informal and even 
formal evidence of consent. Calls for inclusive development addressing racial and income

concerns and climate change mitigation and adaptation, together measured by such emerging 
metrics as Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) factors, are becoming a new normal 
for much real estate investment and development. 
 
 Success in current and future urban environments will require facility with customized 
analytic methods, understanding of contextual frameworks, engagement with critical debates and 
theories, and acquisition of specialized knowledge if urban planners and designers, public 
policymakers, real estate developers, and other interested parties want to be effective city 
builders. Private actors must learn navigational skills befitting a world in which public claims to 
private profit, often under the label “value capture,” are likely to increase. It will not be enough 
to advance self-interest if it fails to include the public interest. 
 
Public actors must grasp the financial realities of private development if they are to 
negotiate viable public-private deals and obtain public benefits through the development 
approval process. They must also take on the critique that engagement with the private sector 
may privatize cities in ways harmful to democratic and equity aspirations. All parties must 
comprehend how public-private collaborations may reassign oversight and risk in ways that 
produce unintended consequences for social, economic, and physical aspects of cities. In sum, a 
new class of professional practitioner, the public-private entrepreneur, located in either public or 
private for-profit or not-for-profit sectors, needs a new type of education to address new 
conditions of urban opportunities and constraints. 
 
 This course employs a combination of lectures, discussions, guest case presentations, 
readings, and individual and group exercises to introduce students to the analytic methods, 
contextual frameworks, and implementation techniques necessary to successfully pursue urban 
development from any point of view. The course commences with instruction on analytic 
methods, emphasizing real estate financial analysis while also addressing modified cost-benefit, 
economic impact, and fiscal impact analyses. Early classes also examine legal, institutional, 
political, and ethical frameworks affecting public and private development. Together, the 
analytic methods and contextual frameworks allow for elaboration of decision rules for 
practicing development in cities. 
 
 Specific implementation techniques covered in the course include: 
• public subsidies (grants, loans, tax incentives) 
• public land disposition (request for proposals, auctions, sole source) 
• public land acquisition (eminent domain) 
• provision of physical infrastructure (capital budgets, public-private partnerships, 
exactions, land readjustment, valorization, tax increment financing) 
• private provision of public benefits (exactions, inclusionary zoning, linkage, 
incentive zoning, planning gain) 
• development approval process, including affirmatively furthering fair housing 
mandates 
• community benefits agreements 
• business improvement districts, conservancies, friends organizations

 Most of the implementation techniques are drawn from United States practice, but 
international comparisons are made to demonstrate the range of variation. Students are 
encouraged to pose questions about comparable implementation techniques employed in 
countries outside the United States. 
 
II. COURSE REQUIREMENTS 
 
A. Class Attendance and Participation 
Students are expected to attend every class and participate in class discussions at least 
twice during the semester. The choice of when to participate is left to the student. 
 
B. Reading Assignments 
 Students are expected to spend an average of two hours per class on required reading 
assignments. Background readings are not required but are provided for those who seek to delve 
deeper into the subject matter. During times that individual and team assignments are underway, 
reading assignments are usually  reduced. Readings are posted through Modules in Canvas and 
include articles, book excerpts, professional reports, and legal documents. 
 
C. Individual Written Assignments 
 There are two individual written assignments. The first individual written assignment 
asks students to complete a real estate financial analysis and, although ungraded, must be 
submitted. The second individual written assignment asks students to determine appropriate 
amounts of public subsidy for a given project and compare subsidy delivery mechanisms. 
 
D. Team Assignment 
The team assignment places students in either a government or private developer team for 
purposes of arranging a deal for the sale/lease and subsequent private development of a 
government-owned land parcel. Several written deliverables are required as part of this 
assignment. 
 
E. Final Exam 
 The final exam is a three-hour, open-book, take-from-anywhere exam that will be 
scheduled during the Design School’s final exam period of May 5-6. The specific day and time 
will be announced early in the semester, as soon as it is set by the Design School administration. 
 
F. Grading 
 The final exam counts for 40% of the grade, the individual public subsidy assignment 
counts for 30%, and the land disposition and development team assignment counts for 30%. For 
the team assignment, students will receive the same grade as other members of their team unless 
assessments of individual contributions indicate that an adjustment is appropriate. 
 
G. Voluntary Review Sessions 
 There are voluntary review sessions, taught by the Teaching Associate, covering real 
estate financial analysis, Microsoft Excel for real estate financial analysis, and other topics.  
 
H. Software 
Page 4 of 16 
Public and Private Development 
Spring 2022 
 
Real estate professionals often employ Microsoft Excel for real estate financial analysis. 
Although the course does not require students to use Excel, it is recommended that students learn 
how to use it. Review sessions are provided to assist in this effort. 
  
I. Office Hours 
 I hold office hours each Wednesday, 2:00 pm to 4:00 pm. Sign up through the Calendly 
link posted above. If you cannot make office hours, we can arrange to meet at another time. The 
Teaching Associate and Teaching Fellow will also hold office hours. 
 
J. Ethics 
 You are expected to abide by all school policies with regard to academic integrity and 
honesty. Please consult school handbooks for further information.
