**Ponderosa**
This forest has roots
ten thousand years deep
and branches of lightning.
Rain fell as needles here,
drying on the ground
where summers grew longer
and fire
found a home to return to.

-- David Chorlton

In January 2022 the BBC ran an article with a series of infographics intended to help readers wrap their heads around the spread of the Australian fires. In a section that was intended to discuss the importance of evacuations, one graphic compared three speeds:  the spread of a forest fire (6.7 mph), a grass fire (14 mph) and an average person running (6.12 mph). I found the info-graphic puzzling. The image itself had the aesthetic of mid 2000s clip-art and the numbers were incredibly vague. Was the average person clocking 6.12 mph a sprint or a sustained run? Over what kind of terrain? Was the spread of a forest fire with or without favorable winds? Was the intended implication that a human can outrun a forest fire but not a bushfire? Honing in on an infographic likely made by a haggard journalist to make a simple point might be unfair, but I bring it up because I think it points to lack of nuance and dexterity in our understanding of fire. Unlike the trees in the wild, we have not had the time to develop an understanding of fire rooted in periodic, moderate fires. Instead we are developing our understanding in the context of extreme, devastating ones. 

In 2014 a team of forest managers and fire scientists invited 10 artists to what they described as "Fire Science Bootcamp" in the mountains of Northern Arizona. The result of this camp was a traveling art exhibit and the publication, Fires of Change: The Art of Fire Science. Katharina Roth and Craig Goodworth describe this work as a project of archiving. Taking the fragile medium of a tree core, casting it into clay and firing it so that the information encoded in the wood can be preserved in a stone-like medium.
