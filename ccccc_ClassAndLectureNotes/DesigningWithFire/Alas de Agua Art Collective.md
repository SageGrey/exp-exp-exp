Alas de Agua art collective grew out of the New Mexico Murals Project, a group of New Mexico based artists who collaborated with schoolchildren to paint murals that center indigenous stories, alternative histories, and environmental justice. The group was founded by Israel Haros Lopez, a Mexican-American artist from East Los Angeles. In an interview with the Santa Fe New Mexican Lopez explained his work saying, "the key to a lot of my projects is that everybody gets involved because we’re all a part of the community.”

Alas de Agua has continued to focus on murals as a way to "provide relentless hope, not only through the visionary landscape provided by the content on the wall but also from the engagement across neighborhoods and social-economic divides." Alas de Agua has grown to become a hub of support for marginalized artists through providing resources and opportunities such as:  small grants, art shows, and open mics.
