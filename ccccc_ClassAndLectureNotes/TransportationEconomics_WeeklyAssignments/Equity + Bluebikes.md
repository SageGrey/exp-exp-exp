This week I want to think about what would be needed in order to optimize Bluebike stations according to two different philosophies of "right distribution" 

**Utilitarianism:** 
What might this look like: Bluebike stations are put at locations where they would be used by the greatest number of people. This could potentially generate more riders in the bluebike system which could expand the number of stations and bikes overall. 

Disadvantages: Locations where there is less overall demand, people who would like to use bluebikes would have fewer options. This scenario would likely lead to lots of stations near university campuses. 

In order to achieve this distribution you would need reliable information about where demand is highest. This could in part be observed with existing data on full/empty stations as well as some method of surveying potential users. It is important to keep in mind that where people would poll that they wanted stations is likely to not show equitable outcomes (Piatowski, 2017). 

**Capabilities Approach**
Advantages: Bluebike stations within a reasonable walking distance of all addresses in Boston region. 

Disadvantages: Given that this might mean locating stations in areas of low usage (at the cost of putting stations in high usage zones) it might reduce the overall revenue that bluebikes has to work with, reducing the number of overall bikes and stations. This could also be a result of stations being positioned that are hard to service. 

What information would you need: One way to figure out a level of adequacy would be to create bikesheds of Boston region.
