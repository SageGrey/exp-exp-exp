When I lived in Chicago I got to experience the tremendous frustration of a rail transit system that assumed all travelers just wanted to go to the loop. My experience was that much of the life of the city happening in neighborhood centers, but despite being close as the bird flies (or the car drives) the L would demand that a traveler follow one of the ribbons down to the loop before wrapping around the 'central business district' and coming back.  The L follows the logic of the assumptions made for the Alonso-Muth-Mills model but poorly served many of the transit riders (Kulish et al., 2011). The bus network as a whole does a better job mimicing patterns of people who want to move between neighborhoods, but since the buses largely follow a grid, and neighborhood centers are frequently diagonal from each other, two buses are almost always required. One interesting component of Bike Share is that it exists somewhat outside of the realm of a mono-centric or even polycentric city. Looking at a map of Divvy Bike stations, there is no discernable pattern of where the "centers" of the city are. This is in sharp contrast to the public transit maps which reveal a perceived "center" of the city.
