This week, I'm generally musing about how we could calculate the consumer surplus generated by adding a new blue-bike station. The premise is a little funky because it's hard to know exactly how many rides a new station enables (elasticity of ridership). It's also hard to know if a new station will induce demand (if people see a station near where they are living or working) and how much will be latent demand (easing the commute of people who already use Bluebikes.)

To try to simplify the question, I want to constrain it by looking at a bluebike station outside a large office building (with little other land uses around).

Say a business wants to put a Bluebike station in front of their building to help encourage their employees to  bike/take transit to work. If the closest Bluebike station is currently a 10-minute walk away, 
1. how much consumer surplus would be generated by them putting in a new station and
2. what would be the cost per hour of consumer surplus? 

**Assumptions**:
* Blue Bikes of Boston charges businesses $75,000 to install a Bluebike station with 19 bikes for a 6-year contract (CambridgeMa.Gov, 2022) It is unclear if BlueBikes is charging businesses the full cost or if this is subsidized, but we will assume for now that it is the full cost. S we will assume that the daily cost is (75,000 / 6 years / 365 days = **$34.24/day)**
* We will assume that every day 80% of the docks are available to employees of that building so there are daily a minimum of 19 * 0.8 = **15 slots open for commuters.** 
* We will assume that each commuter who can use one of those docks will save **10 minutes each way** off their commute. 

**Calculations**:
```

(10 min) x (2 commutes) x 15 employees = 300 Surplus Minutes or 5 Hours. 

$34.34/5hrs = The cost per hour of this consumer surplus is $6.87 per hour

```
