(a few) COMPONENTS OF PLEASURE 

#### Overview
*Without new visions we don’t know what to build, only what to knock down. We not only end up confused, rudderless, and cynical, but we forget that making a revolution is not a series of clever maneuvers and tactics but a process that can and must transform us. (Kelley, 2022)*

**Research Proposition**
In the coming year I wish to develop a design thesis that explores how urban planners can use pleasure as a lens to see urban environments. In order to illustrate and develop this idea, I will primarily look at a specific urban institution---Boston Bluebikes--- and try to show how analyzing this system against components (and conditions) of pleasure can lead to designs that center joy. This thesis would extend into the realm of urban planning the work of theorists such as Adrienne Marree Brown, Robin D. G. Kelley, Audre Lorde, Bell Hooks who have written about the importance of centering pleasure and visions of the future in the quest towards liberation. The thesis would also situate itself within the existing body of literature on Bikeshare programs. 

**What do I mean by Pleasure**
Obviously there is no single all-encompassing definition for pleasure. The words in english we use to describe pleasure--Joy, Comfort, Satisfaction--are all words that claim an enormous share of disparate human sensations. What one person finds pleasurable is often pleasurable to many others, but not to all. When I use pleasure I mean to describe a spectrum of enjoyable human sensations. A central component of this thesis would be developing a more evolved framework to discuss conditions and components of pleasure. Below are some jumping off points that I'm using to conceptualize pleasure. 

The first jumping-off point are **conditions of pleasure**. In this thesis I would want to focus on these conditions with the understanding that BIPOC and diabled communites are often denied these conditions in public spaces (Hendren, 2020). 

|Conditions of Pleasure|
|---|
|Access|
|Safety|


The second jumping-off point is thinking about **components of pleasure.** Currently I imagine that a more-developed version of this would form the structure of the thesis. I would examine the Bluebike system through these various components.  

|Physical Pleasure|Emotional Pleasure|Enabling Pleasure|
|---|---|---|
|[Relief from extremes](327_reliefFromWeather.md)|Autonomy + Control|Physical Access|
| Playful or Enjoyable Sensations| Self Expression | All Hour Access | 
| Comfort |Aesthetic Beauty||
 | Conserved Effort|Speed||| 
 |Natural Elements|Endorphins||
 | Pleasant Lighting |Pleasant Surprises||
 ||Connection to Place||
 

Another way that I want to think about pleasure is about how pleasure is experienced.

|**Pleasure Dimensions**| |
|---|---|---|
|*Experienced Pleasure/Displeasure*|*Anticipated Pleasure*|*Definitional Pleasure*|
|I enjoyed that|I'm looking forward to that|This is a thing I enjoy|

**Approach with Bluebikes**

Component A: Learn everything I can about Boston Bluebikes and Bikeshare 
Component B: Think about Bluebikes through questions such as "how does bluebikes allow for 'comfort in hot/cold temperatures'" or "how could bluebikes allow for more access to concerts at North Station"
Component C: Talk with others in "pleasure mapping" exercises


**Initial Ideas**
 * Adding Bluebike Tricycles with Big Cargo Baskets that would broaden who feels safe riding a blue bike and what kinds of tasks can be accomplished on bikes (Component of Pleasure: Access, Versatility)
 * Introduce *Electric Hand Bikes* which could allow some folks who use wheelchairs to access the BlueBike fleet. 
 * Introduce some form of "voting" or participatory budgeting into where new stations are located (Component of Pleasure: Sense of Control/Voice)
 * Examine how "valet service" could be used more often for "pleasurable events" (not just commuting rush-hour) (Component of Pleasure: Access to Pleasure)
 * Metal Pole  Hand Warmer at Winter Stations (Compoent of Pleasure: Relief From Extremes)

> Pleasure Lens
> This thesis is about how using a **lens of pleasure** in urban planning could enhance the way that we design and curate our built environments. The thesis proposes different improvements that Boston Bluebikes could implement in order to be redesigned to better facilitate pleasure.
