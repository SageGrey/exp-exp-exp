I want to walk barefoot
in a place where barefoot has no name
in a place where soul on Earth
is natural 
a place where toes in soil 
is common as
true love
laughter
and birth...

I want to walk barefoot
in cities without streets 
where admiration is a deep silence
and conversations are replaced by the eloquence of eyes 
barefoot in a place
where excuses are not enforced in law books
where there is no law
only that which is right
