This project will salvage metal from a structure fire, recast it, and then use it to recreate the outline of the building that once stood. The chosen site for this project will be a former community space such as a library, coffee shop, movie theater, or restaurant. After the outline has been laid, community members will be invited to come to the lot and plant native vegetation along the metal lines. Chairs, picnic tables and shade structures will be brought in to facilitate the development of a gathering space. 

The intention of this project is not necessarily to rebuild, but to commemorate. And to make space for a reeling, traumatized community to process what they are experiencing. 

This project is inspired by the visionary climate scientist and writer, Dr. Ayana Elisabeth Johnson. In her work, Dr. Johnson argues that the work of responding to climate change is not just work that needs to happen in specific sectors such as energy and policy, but a societal project. In discussing large-scale climate disruption, Dr. Johnson argues that we need to build up "New Traditions [^1]" These New Traditions will be social structures that can support the unprecedented emotions and logistical decisions that will arise in our new era of large-scale upheaval. 

The canary in the coal mine for wildfire devastating communities in the United States was the 2018 Camp Fire. Wildfires that destroy homes and communities have been relatively rare in the United States so far[^2], but as climate change fuels fire conditions, this is expected to change. And in the aftermath of the Camp Fire, our Canary is not doing well.  Four years after the fire, former Paradise residents are dealing with unprecedented rates of PTSD and mental health trauma along with steep rates of displacement and homelessness[^3]. The clinical model of mental healthcare cannot keep up when an entire town needs help. And housing costs in the West remains an issue plastered across newspaper headlines. 

A gathering space does not solve these problems. A commemoration does not mark the end. But what the residents of Paradise have taught us is that collective healing is worth pursuing. For example, a program run out of Chico State University has been hosting therapeutic walks in the woods for former Paradise residents. The program guides residents through a Japanese tradition of *Shinrin-ryoho* or "forest bathing." By creating space for positive interactions with nature, the program, while small, has managed to provide a form of therapy and solace to people who cannot reach other options[^4].
