## Pleasure Audits
The research method I am planning to use in this thesis project is what I'm describing as a "Pleasure Audit." I will develop a series of questions that will allow me to examine and evaluate transportation infrastructure according to how it offers or denies  pleasure. 


### How will the Audit be Conducted
The pleasure audit will rely principally on observation and photography, supplemented with public records including: transportation department budgets, annual reports and news reports.

### Why call it an "audit"
* Audits are grounded in what currently is, they are grounded in observation. I think that by looking at  
* We use audits for aspects of a system that are **critical** such as: Safety, Corruption, Moneysaving. By using the term audit, I hope to make an argument that we should consider pleasure as critical. 
* We also use audits when we are concerned about how a system is operating and we want to know if there needs to be an intervention. 


### What's the difference between an Audit and a SWOT analysis or Structure Observation? 
* The Name
* Elements shared with a SWOT 
	* Big Picture Thinking
*  Elements Shared with Structured Observation
	* Having guiding Questions 
* The audit compares modes of transportation in a given location to each other.
