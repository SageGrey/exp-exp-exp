#IDEA 
Giving riders opportunities for input or power in determining where bikeshare stations are located might be a way to bring more autonomy or feelings of agency into a bikeshare system. The following are ideas on how Bluebikes could introduce more agency into the system. 

##### Method for **Consultation**
Every month Bluebikes would have a survey to get input from riders about where they would like to have stations or rebalancing services. 

>**Survey Eligibility:** Membership or One ride that month
>**Survey Delivery:** Through App or Texted to Casual Riders after they finish a ride

>**Survey Questions:** 
>1. *Drop A Pin on Map:* If you could put a station anywhere, where would you put it? 
> 2. I would like [station] to have more [bikes or docks] during [time of day] every [time of week]


##### Method for **Delegated Power**

Every year, Bluebikes would set aside a fund of its capital investment budget that would be voted on in a participatory budgeting process. 

> Considerations **Equity**
> Given that often efforts to collect input on community stations has led to unequal distribution (Piatkowski et al., 2017), one way to nudge this process could be to divide BlueBikeRiders into districts. For members, this could be done with a zipcode or members selecting a "home station."
