Hello and welcome! 

This is a map that attempts to identify **components of pleasure** as well as **ideas on how to incorporate pleasure into transportation**

For the sake of this  exercise, I have broken pleasure into three realms. The boundaries between these realms are hazy (and ultimately, imaginary), but they are employed here in hopes that it allows us think more clearly about what can bring different folks pleasure. 

* ### [[Physical Pleasure]] 
	Physical pleasure is pleasure that is rooted in sensations such as comfort, adrenaline, and bodily needs. 
* ### [[Psychological Pleasure]]> 
	Psychological pleasure is pleasure that pertains to emotional needs and desires. 
* ### [[Enabling Pleasure]]
	Enabling pleasure refers to components of a transportation network that don't themselves bring pleasure, but enable pleasurable activities or sensations elsewhere.
