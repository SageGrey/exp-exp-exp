Have a metal loop that is being warmed by radiant heating that cyclists can use to warm their hands on after they finish a ride. Could be powered by the solar panels at bike share stations. 

**> Questions:** 
> 1. How much energy is needed to heat a radiant pole
> 2. Could this be solar powered? 
> 3. What is the wattage of the Bluebike solar panels? 


**Research:** 
>"Most heated tile floors and electric floor heating systems use 12 watts per hour per square foot, meaning a 100-square-foot room would use 1200 watts in total every hour, or 300 watts LESS than the average space heater.[^1]
