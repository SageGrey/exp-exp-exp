## **Section 1:** Re-statement of why this thesis matters

#### 1. Transportation Planning has placed too much emphasis on commuting
Transportation planning in the United States has tended to focus on getting high-income workers to jobs in central business districts [^1]. This approach has always been myopic, but it is especially misguided in a new era of remote work and radically shifted work patterns. Setting 'commuting to work' as the primary form of transportation has prioritized the needs of affluent white communities over BIPOC communities (ACT-LA, 2020), has prioritized men’s transit needs over women’s transit needs (Perez, 2020), and has prioritized high-wage over low-wage workers. But it has also helped to create a system that is ill-suited for residents to engage in leisure activities. While cities have become more dispersed (Montgomery, 2014), engaging in many leisure activities has become less accessible without a car.

#### 2. Pleasure and Leisure For All Matters
Free time, Leisure and Pleasure are all essential human needs but are largely not given much weight and thought in planning decisions. This impacts everyone, but it is especially impactful for folks who find themselves unable to afford a car.  It's hard to fathom the sheer magnitude of harm caused by transportation planning's past in Boston and around the country. Decisions made in past eras, like the destruction of Black neighborhoods so that white suburban residents could drive on highways, still shape and harm communities across the country. But like other aching injustices, the path to righting past wrongs and fighting for transit justice remains a dispiriting and painful process . A reason to think about transportation through the lens of pleasure is that it makes room for analysis and community visioning that is allowed to dwell on something beyond the problems. In this project we've look to precedent such as abolitionist activists Adrienne Maree Brown and Robin D. G. Kelley, asset-based planning, and the work of the grassroot activist organization ACT-LA. 


#### 3. Decarbonization could be an opportunity to focus on leisure

_Without new visions, we don’t know what to build, only what to knock down.__
We not only end up confused, rudderless, and cynical, but we forget that making a revolution  is not a series of clever maneuvers and tactics, but a process that can and must transform us– Robin D. G. Kelley, Freedom Dreams_ _

The central premise of the Green New Deal is that if we are to be successful in creating a sustainable, climate-aware future, we need to also address issues of racial and economic justice. Implicit in this sentiment is that we can’t just divest from harmful industries, but we must actively invest in sustainable endeavors that can provide just, livable wages. As Mass and other states reach for decarbonization goals (Carbon Neutral by 2050), there will need to be accompanying
